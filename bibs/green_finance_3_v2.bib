abstract={This analysis explores the role of the private sector relative to all health spending among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Bi-variate regression was employed for 31 countries using current data. It was found that the share of GDP allocated to health varies among countries, ranging from 5 percent in Turkey to 14 percent in the United States. Variation in per capita income explains much of this difference but other factors are important too. One appears to be the role of the private sector in financing health expenditures. Our analysis concludes that concern about rising health sector costs should be placed in a larger context: rising health care costs may be justified if benefits are large enough and cover the opportunity costs of alternative uses of resources. Key words: sustainMlity, health expenditures, efficiency, institutions, private finance, public finance, technology, comparative systems. © 2004 Aspen Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations (SOPDEs) in various forms arise and are successfully utilized in the modeling of a variety of physical and engineered systems such as telecommunication systems, electronic circuits, cosmological systems, financial systems, meteorological and climate systems. While the theory of stochastic partial and especially ordinary differential equations is more or less well understood, there has been much less work on practical formulations and computational approaches to solving these equations. In this paper, we concentrate on the stochastic non-linear Schrödinger equation (SNLSE) that arises in the analysis of wave propagation phenomena, mainly motivated by its predominant role as a modeling tool in the design of optically amplified long distance fiber telecommunication systems. We present novel formulations and computational methods for the stochastic characterization of the solution of the SNLSE. Our formulations and techniques are not aimed at computing individual realizations, i.e., sample paths, for the solution of the SNLSE á la Monte Carlo. Instead, starting with the SNLSE, we derive new systems of differential equations and develop associated computational techniques. The numerical solutions of these new equations directly produce the ensemble-averaged stochastic characterization desired for the solution of the SNLSE, in a non-Monte Carlo manner without having to compute many realizations needed for ensemble-averaging. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Policy-makers initially held an exaggerated idea of how ICT could generate new employment in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. They hoped that state-provided ICT resources might function as a growth pole, much as the natural resource of North Sea oil had done in the 1970s. After 15 years of 'top-down' investment, only a relatively small number of migrant workers and call-centre jobs have been attracted to the region. During the same time, however, ICT has been used far more widely than expected as a 'bottom-up' tool to support existing ventures such as tourism, to provide community services and to provide better training and education throughout the region. The net effect of investment has been to maintain overall population growth levels. ICT is therefore helping to 'hold the line' by supporting existing industries and services. However, this has only been achieved through hundreds of thousands of pounds of private and public sector investment and the region is still far from achieving sustainable development without continued financial support. Unlike roads, electricity cables or street lights, ICT is an area of infrastructure that quickly becomes obsolete, as the Community TeleCottage initiative showed. Frequent rounds of new investment are needed if state-of-the-art facilities are to be maintained in the long term and new migrant teleworkers are to be attracted. For instance, when broadband is replaced by a superior service, as it inevitably will be, who will pay for the next phase of development? How much will it cost? To maintain its impressive lead in this field over most other rural areas of Europe, the Highlands and Islands is likely to remain dependent upon financial aid for the foreseeable future.},

abstract={This paper analyses the issues of public finance sustainability and suitability of strategies aimed at fiscal consolidation, contrasting growth-based versus thrift-based strategies. Empirically, this study investigates the experiences with con soli-dation over the I990s in the U. S., Japan, and the eurozone while scrutinizing disparities within Europe. It is argued that neither Germany’s virtuous stability-oriented past, which in many ways provided the blueprint for the Maastricht regime’s design, nor any other small economy’s peculiar record with consolidation offers any guidance to the EMU today. For that purpose only the case of the US case may be relevant, featuring cooperative macroeconomic policies geared at steering domestic demand growth, with sustainable public finances as a con - sequence of their success. Reforms should thus focus on securing cooperation and proper growth orientation in macroeconomic policymaking, which may be achieved through committing fiscal and monetary policies to common goals and a nominal GDP targeting strategy. © 2004, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.

It would operate as a large fund into which rich countries would pay based on their level of population, per capita income and change in a measure of environmental sustainability. Receipts from the funds, called Country Undertakings and Rights for Environmental Sustainability (CURES), would be made to poor countries based on their population, per capita income and absolute level of environmental sustainability. This approach differentiates payments and receipts on the basis of income, while rewarding improvements in environmental performance in rich countries, and making greater payments to countries with greater environmental problems. To promote flexibility, recipient countries would be able to trade, bank or borrow their assigned CURES, provided that the trade resulted in a verifiable improvement in environmental sustainability in the purchasing country. A reformed GEF that adopted the desirable features of CURES, if widely adopted and funded at a sufficiently high level, would offer a significant boost to global SD and would greatly assist poor countries to address the twin challenges of poverty and environmental degradation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Coming from a short international review reasons for networking of scientific research in Germany are given. Success and challenges of medical competence networks are listed, and it is argued how important it is to bridge networks in health care and medical research networks. Some examples from internal medicine are given. The prominent central role of patients is emphasized. Finally it is stated that Germany so far has not established the prerequisites to implement sustainable collaborative infrastructures. Specifically financial, legal, and political support is missing. In addition, it becomes clear that - in contrast to the USA - Germany lacks sufficient medical-informatics specialists as well as health managers trained to manage IT or networked research. The planned introduction of a telematics infrastructure for health in Germany is perceived as a big chance for improvement.},

abstract={Knowledge management (KM) is of increasing interest to a number of leading UK construction organizations. Companies are keen to find out what other organizations are doing both within the construction and other industry sectors. There are important lessons to be learned from Canadian oil and gas organizations on how they manage their knowledge. A case study is used to explore the KM activities of eight leading organizations and investigate the opportunities for construction organizations to adopt some of their ideas. Three areas are covered: KM strategy and implementation, people aspects of KM and metrics for KM performance. There are several potential lessons for UK organizations: the need for KM to be driven by senior management if it is to have any notable success; the use of people-centred techniques for sharing tacit knowledge and IT tools for sharing explicit knowledge; the importance of selling solutions to project teams to obtain employee support for KM; peer recognition has a more sustainable impact than financial reward; and KM measurement should be considered as a way of improving its impact, rather than justifying expenditure. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

abstract={Growing concerns about the sustainability of the fiscal policy in India have evoked serious concerns in the recent past. The present paper has assessed the Indian fiscal trends in terms of inter-temporal budget constraint (IBC) for the Central and State Governments separately and together by employing Gregory and Hansen [J. Econometrics 70 (1996) 99] tests of co-integration with structural breaks. By addressing the issue of regime shift, this paper finds that while the fiscal stance of the Central and the State Government at the individual level is unsustainable, it is weakly sustainable for the combined finances as it nets out inter-governmental financial flows. Thus, claims about sustainability of India's public finance, made on the basis of the assessment of individual finances and neglecting inter-governmental flows and the possibility of regime shifts seems exaggerated. © 2004 Society for Policy Modeling.

abstract={The authors have analyzed general and/or branch and basic strategic industrial developmental features in the Republic of Croatia, and with this made efforts to enable the increase of comprehension of the sustainable development dynamics of the Adriatic coastal region, through three key developmental challenges: conservation of the natural scenery and biodiversity, conservation of cultural heritage and introducing tourist industry. The results of the opinion pool have been presented, carried out among a hundred of key developmental protagonists, from government administration and institutions significant on the national, regional and local level, international financial and developmental institutions, as well as companies, on the subject of financing sustainable development of the coastal, high seas and island region. Along with the identification of present projects and programmes, by which the realisation of the sustainable development postulates at the Adriatic coastal region, high seas and islands, as well as the amount of the annual financial investments is being encouraged, the results of the opinion pool have shown that there is a series of obstacles to financing a sustainable development - institutional, legal, financial, but in the last few years a significant progress in each field of activity has been present. The conclusion is that there is not a unique strategy of the sustainable development of the Adriatic coastal, high seas and island region, by which it could be possible to comprehensively conceive branch developmental challenges and their sustainability, as well as effective planning of financial resources of the future programmes and projects.},

abstract={The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the associated Kyoto Protocol set in place a structure for the stabilisation of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Kyoto Protocol commits participating industrialised countries to binding emission reduction commitments and introduces flexibility mechanisms, including emissions trading and the CDM. Under the CDM, emission reductions from project activities undertaken in developing (or non-Annex 1) countries may be utilised by industrialised countries to help meet their emission reduction commitments. Rules, procedures and methodologies for the implementation of CDM projects are emerging, and the market for emission reduction certificates or "carbon credits" is rapidly expanding. The sugar industry is well placed to benefit from carbon finance under the CDM, and to date a number of bagasse cogeneration CDM projects have been implemented. The role of fuel ethanol and other liquid bio-fuels in the CDM is less advanced, but the CDM will play an important role in the development and diffusion of renewable transport fuels.},

abstract={The national target for PV capacity in Japan is 4.82 GW in 2010, and several PV Roadmaps until 2030 are also described. To achieve the target, several support programs, such as subsidization to capital cost, Green Credit by the Green Power Certification System, buy-back under the Renewable Portfolio Standard low, have been already introduced. Carbon tax is still under consideration, but there are several analyses about possible carbon tax. The purpose of this paper is to analyze PV system sales price and subsidy through buy-back which make photovoltaics cost-competitive with other energy technologies and make the target for PV capacity achievable by 2030 in Japan under an expected carbon tax. For the analysis energy system of Japan is modeled by using MARKAL. Based on the results of analysis, under 6000 JPY/t-C carbon tax, photovoltaics needs subsidy for a while even if we taking both fuel savings and Green Credit into account. For attaining the national target for PV capacity in 2010, photovoltaics needs more expensive buy-back than that in present, but after 2010 necessary buy-back decreases gradually. If 120 JPY/W PV system sales price is attained by 2030, photovoltaics becomes cost-competitive without any supports. Subsidy through buy-back becomes almost unnecessary in 2030, if we can reduce it less than 170 JPY/W. The total necessary buy-back meets peak in 2025. It is much more than ongoing subsidy to capital cost of PV systems, but annual revenue from the assumed carbon tax can finance the annual total necessary buy-back. This means if photovoltaics can attain the targeted PV system sales price, we should support it for a while by spending carbon tax revenue effectively and efficiently. © 2004, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

abstract={Multiple-choice testing (MCT) has several advantages which are becoming more relevant in the current financial climate. In particular, they can be machine marked. As an objective testing method it is particularly relevant to engineering and other factual courses, but MCTs are not widely used in engineering because students can benefit from guessing. In the formation of a professional engineer, guessing must be actively discouraged and this has led to this testing method being used only rarely in engineering courses. This paper describes trials of a modification to the basic MCT which is designed to assess the students' ability to use their knowledge correctly and confidently. Students are asked to select the correct answer, as usual, then to indicate their confidence in that choice. The marking scheme does not reward guessing, and misplaced confidence is penalized. Statistical results based on over 2500 answers are presented, together with survey responses. The students' attitude to the tests has been that they are fair but challenging. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The buildings in which customers receive services are inherently part of the service experience. Given the high stress of illness, healthcare facility designs are especially likely to have a meaningful impact on customers. In the past, a handful of visionary "healing environments" such as the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California; Griffin Hospital in Derby, Connecticut; Woodwinds Health Campus in St. Paul, Minnesota; and San Diego Children's Hospital were built by values-driven chief executive officers and boards and aided by philanthropy when costs per square foot exceeded typical construction costs. Designers theorized that such facilities might have a positive impact on patients' health outcomes and satisfaction. But limited evidence existed to show that such exemplary health facilities were superior to conventional designs in actually improving patient outcomes and experiences and the organization's bottom line. More evidence was needed to assess the impact of innovative health facility designs. Beginning in 2ooo, a research collaborative of progressive healthcare organizations voluntarily came together with The Center for Health Design to evaluate their new buildings. Various "Pebble Projects" are now engaged in three-year programs of evaluation, using comparative research instruments and outcome measures. Pebble Projects include hospital replacements, critical care units, cancer units, nursing stations, and ambulatory care centers. The Pebble experiences are synthesized here in a composite 3oo-bed "Fable Hospital" to present evidence in support of the business case for better buildings as a key component of better, safer, and less wasteful healthcare. The evidence indicates that the one-time incremental costs of designing and building optimal facilities can be quickly repaid through operational savings and increased revenue and result in substantial, measurable, and sustainable financial benefits.},

For the most vulnerable, only part of these resources are likely to be met by governments and the Convention's financial provisions. Lack of public funding has led to exploration of insurance schemes (public and privately funded). Experience of insurance markets, including responses by the industry to the increased frequency of extreme weather events, is useful in guiding policy developments in this area. The article suggests there are limits to the availability of commercial weather-related insurance in developed and developing countries. Micro-finance schemes may be useful. Additionally, the financial services sector may end up playing a role in prompting mitigation responses in order to prevent some climate impacts from occurring and thus limit the amount of adaptation insurance/funding needed in the future.},

Ways of measuring proliferation and fragmentation are described demonstrating that some of the worst proliferators are countries with otherwise progressive aid policies. Climate funding benefits from having a centralised and highly coordinated funding mechanism under the direct political control of the Convention Parties, but large amounts of aid for climate activities flow outside the Convention's financial mechanism. Because climate change activities cover many sectors and the political economy of aid creates incentives for donors to proliferate, large, parallel flows will exist for some time. Further research documenting the effects of proliferation in the context of climate change is needed before policy options such as budgetary support, sector-wide approaches and other initiatives can be further considered.},

abstract={Anthropological, sociological, historical, and psychological approaches are combined to explore three divergent orientations to masculine success among American farmers. With a focus on the moral economy of the family, we link dimensions of work, livelihood, and marital partnership to the emotional consequences of women’s off-farm work. We contrast agrarian and industrial ideals found in Georgia, Iowa, and Illinois and connect their emergence to the transformation of the American economy over the last 100 years. Psychological and survey data from an Iowa study show some preliminary support for the Georgia findings that a more industrial notion of farmers’masculinity, emphasizing income and lifestyle and an expectation that a man will be the sole breadwinner of the family, confers a heavier emotional burden in a time of financial crisis. The Midwestern sustainable agriculture movement has given rise to a “third wave” of masculinity, a less competitive and individualistic ideology, emerging from a more global ecological awareness. © 2006, SAGE Publications.

abstract={The research reported in this paper identifies those factors that, taken together with Information Systems (IS) augmentations, affect the competitive positioning of businesses. The research focuses on the financial services, retailing and manufacturing sectors, spanning the levels of business information intensity found in the UK. The paper is in two parts. The first deals with the scope and duration of the achievement of IS-enabled enhanced competitive positioning. Around 25% of businesses in the sample were judged to have at least one IS that allowed the organisation to gain competitive advantage, whilst 30% were judged to have at least one IS that nullified a competitor's advantage. Broadly, all sectors showed the same pattern. The median time that a competitive advantage was held was between 6 and 18 months. The second part of the paper is concerned with the establishment of an IS-enabled opportunity framework, identifying the associated business benefits, the associated changes in competitive position, and the sources of sustainable achievement. Twenty-two factors were identified as being significant in turning a business benefit into a competitive advantage, and seven were identified as significant in converting this competitive advantage into a sustainable one. These factors were overwhelmingly within the internal architecture of the organisation. The findings support the view that sustainable IS-enabled competitive advantage is elusive. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This article analyses existing small-scale wind farms located in India as hypothetical projects implemented under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). It addresses them from three different viewpoints (sustainable development, financial feasibility and institutional conditions), focusing mostly on identifying the smallest capacities and lowest performances at which these cases may become attractive for CDM investors. Although the case studies exhibit the potential to achieve the dual objective of the CDM; based on our estimates of related transaction costs we find that small-scale CDM wind farms that generate a minimum of 3,500–5,000 certified emission reductions (CERs) per year may start to attract the attention of CDM investors, as long as a minimum of just US$5 per CER is obtained and supportive strategies such as project bundling and unilateral implementation model are in place. Lessons from the Indian wind-energy experience indicate that non-Annex I countries interested in attracting the attention of CDM investors for wind-energy projects should undertake domestic efforts to build institutional and human competences capable of supporting both their domestic windenergy markets and the development of CDM wind-energy projects in general. Some policy recommendations are drawn. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The purpose of the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) program, adopted at the first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is to foster the transfer of technology for global warming abatement from developed to developing countries. Projects should not only reduce greenhouse gases, but also contribute to the sustainable development goals of host countries. However, given the lack of consensus regarding the definition and measurement of sustainable development, it is difficult to gauge to what extent the AIJ phase has been useful for developing countries. In this paper, we adopt a macro perspective and analyse the real-life data of 210 projects with respect to equity and financial issues related to sustainable development in a broad sense. We focus only on three aspects (financial additionality, credit sharing and geographical distribution) and conclude that the performance of the AIJ program was in general fairly poor. Because the AIJ experience prepares the grounds and is fundamental for the design of two project-based mechanisms from the Kyoto Protocol (JI and CDM), these failures must be overcome and strong sustainable development criteria must be set for each project.

abstract={This article addresses the experiences gained by 19 Dutch companies with corporate social responsibility (CSR). These companies joined the programme 'From financial to sustainable profit' of the National Initiative for Sustainable Development (NIDO), which ran from May 2000 until December 2002. They focused on two issues: assessing the added value of corporate social responsibility and implementing a structured approach. The Dutch experiment showed that the companies involved were able to specify the added value of CSR by elaborating the economic performance and/or parenting advantage. Unfortunately, a third type of value creation, viz. through protecting the company's reputation, was not elaborated. Moreover, the experiment revealed that among the 19 participating companies experiences were limited in implementing a structured approach towards CSR. By exchanging experiences the companies learned from each other. Such interactive learning turned out to be a helpful support, complementary to the general CSR literature on guidelines, indicators and best practice guides. Although this literature is rapidly growing, knowledge is still lacking in structuring CSR. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

The Institute is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization, that has played a leading role in the Brazilian CSR effort. In Brazil, CSR initiatives have a long tradition of philanthropy, a consequence of the country's great social inequalities. The increased attention to corporate social responsibility has paralleled growing concern about sustainable development and the intensifying activities of pressure groups (consumers, customers, investors, NGOs, labour unions, the media, among others) that have been increasing since the 1990s as natural resources are progressively becoming exhausted, social tensions rising and environmental conditions deteriorating worldwide. This article identifies problems and obstacles to the growth of corporate social responsibility in Brazil, as well as advances and alternatives for CSR and towards creating conditions for the country to be internationally competitive and sustainable in the financial, social and environmental areas. © 2004 United Nations.},

abstract={Since the late 1980s, mutually reinforcing trends in economic growth, public policy, and community activism have fostered a wave of residential mortgage lending to 'underserved markets' in US cities. Yet many of the changes in housing finance that supported sustainable home ownership also lured a new generation of subprime and predatory credit institutions specialising in high-cost, high-risk lending. For many urban and minority neighbourhoods, the old problems of exclusionary redlining are now accompanied by new dilemmas of exploitive greenlining. This paper analyses the market penetration of subprime lending institutions and the subsequent concentration of mortgage 'pre-foreclosures' in low- and moderate-income, African American neighbourhoods. Focusing on Newark, NJ, and its surrounding suburbs, Gary King's ecological inference technique and a series of logistic regression models are used to assess the role of borrower characteristics, institutional divisions, and neighbourhood context in the process of mortgage market segmentation. The evidence corroborates theories emphasising the dynamics of capital investment, financial services restructuring, and the economic incentives for racial-geographic targeting, and not the presumed credit deficiencies of urban and minority home owners. Unfortunately, the tidy empirical analysis offered here is overshadowed by the enormous societal experiment now underway across the US, as a wave of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures undermines the belated minority home ownership gains achieved during the unprecedented boom of the 1990s.},

abstract={1. Agricultural developments over recent decades have had significant negative effects on wildlife. Modern European agriculture faces many further developments in technology, finances and climate. A framework for predicting the consequences of these developments and for informing management that mitigates previous depredation of wildlife is essential. 2. Field trials, monitoring and experimental approaches are all invaluable tools for predicting the consequences of proposed agricultural practices. However, such trials are time-consuming and expensive, with limited spatial and temporal scope. Increasingly, it is recognized that predictive modelling using computer simulations is essential for assessing the likely impacts of novel management practices. 3. Many agricultural developments are likely to have impacts on the availability of food for farmland wildlife. In this paper, we review modelling techniques that are available for predicting the consequences of changing food supplies for farmland birds, a group already shown to be sensitive to agricultural management. 4. We focus on two broad types of simulation modelling: phenomenological approaches (using aggregative responses or full population models), and behavioural depletion models (including daily ration and functional response approaches). We assess the strengths and weaknesses of each, particularly with regard to available data. 5. We conclude that given the constraints on current information, daily ration models probably represent the most useful form of simulation modelling for farmland birds. Few phenomenological population models link demography explicitly to food supply and collecting data on these links should be a priority of autecological studies. More empirical data on aggregative and functional responses is needed to identify the generality of these functions, and to confront uncertainties in their use. 6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling techniques available for predicting the consequences of changing food supply for farmland birds have largely outstripped the availability of data required to parameterize them. We recommend the best available techniques given current constraints on data. Predictive models of biodiversity response should be more widely used when considering proposals for agricultural developments or agri-environment schemes. Models will provide a basis for selecting between competing proposals, whilst their widespread usage will both permit more frequent model validation and aid in model development.},

abstract={Limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases from power generation will depend, among other things, on the continuing and increased use of hydroelectric power. However, climate change itself may alter rainfall patterns, adversely affecting the financial viability of existing and potential hydro schemes. Previous work developed a methodology for quantifying the potential impact of climate change on the economics of hydropower schemes. Here, the analysis is extended to examine the potential for changes in project risk. A case study is presented that indicates that the applied climate change scenarios alter not only the mean financial performance of the scheme but also the financial risk facing it. Given that investors must balance project risk and reward, this finding has implications for the future provision of hydropower.},

abstract={The history of public finances in Portugal from the middle of the nineteenth century to World War I is distinguished by the pursuit of an ambitious programme of public investment in infrastructure, and by the negative financial consequences this elicited, culminating in the 1892 default. In this article we approach the Portuguese financial history of this period with a relatively new methodology for evaluating financial sustainability, which emphasises the inter-temporal nature of government budgeting. The results obtained allow us to quantify the distance that separated Portuguese finances from a sustainable path throughout the period. Although the generational imbalance of Portuguese finances at the time seems massive in the context of today's benchmarks, its economic and financial impact should have been more limited, given the government's relatively low weight in the economy and the favourable demographic pattern.},

abstract={Nuclear energy seawater desalination is a unique technology for the production of freshwater-especially potable water - on a large scale without contributing to greenhouse gases, SOx or NOx etc., which use existing nuclear power plant (NPP) technology and seawater desalination technology. The scarcity of freshwater and especially potable water is jeopardizing many regions of the world. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the world's population may suffer from high or moderate water shortages, with a focus on North Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and South-east Asia. The clean development mechanism (CDM) creates a unique, market-based means by which signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, who are required to comply with emission limitations, can work with developing partners in achieving global reductions in greenhouse gases, while promoting those partners' sustainable development by providing financial and technology assistance. In essence, CDM creates a means for transferring the credit for reducing emissions from projects in developing countries to the sponsors of those projects in developed states. A comparative economic analysis of nuclear seawater desalination was carried out under the CDM. The results were calculated by a desalination economic evaluation program (DEEP2.0) developed by the International Atom Energy Agency which included a pressurized light water reactor (PWR), a pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), a combined cycle gas turbine (CC) and an open cycle gas turbine (GT), in a middle scale of about 600 MWe, and two desalination technologies: reverse osmosis (RO) and multi-effect distillation (MED). The CDM in nuclear seawater desalination cases was realized in quantitative terms, which are carbon taxes of roughly $40-80/t (of carbon), whose sum is equivalent to the annual total thermal production of nuclear power plants on the same scale as coal-fired plants. The calculated results indicated a significant economics benefit for nuclear seawater desalination.},

abstract={The information technology (IT) industry (hardware, software and services) has provided many tools to help generate and process data, communicate globally, and improve productivity. However, all the rapid advances in this sector have not made society more sustainable, in terms of financial, ecological and social measures. Yet, since the IT industry has provided many tools to track, measure, and broadcast the financial performance of companies, IT companies are in a strong position to provide tools to understand, track, and address the social and ecological performance of business. The core argument of this article is that there is potential for IT to transform modern business into a more efficient, cyclical, networked, and sustainability-oriented system that pays returns through economic, ecological, and social prosperity. The article presents strategies and opportunities for the IT industry to become a leader in enabling both business and society to move towards sustainability. It also offers a new vision for the IT sector-as the source of innovation and tools for advancing society towards sustainability and building strong, prosperous sustainability-oriented businesses. © 2003 NetLogex, LLC.

abstract={The discrepancy between the high importance of intangibles and the general inability to measure and account for these types of assets constitutes a growing challenge for business and society, in particular within the framework of Non-Financial Reporting. Traditional financial reporting typically does not provide good predictions of future financial performance. The malfunctioning of risk capital markets partly depends on the lack of reliable information on intangibles. Thus, measurements of intangibles must be significantly improved. The information on intangibles needs to be based on the right measurements, it needs to be comparable (i.e. based on common guidelines, or even standards), and it needs to be verifiable and understood by the users. This paper reviews the situation with reference to measuring intangibles for non-financial reporting. It comments on various related research projects and R&D activities initiated by accounting organizations. It emphasizes the possible importance of various Best Practice measurement programs, such as ACSI and EPSI Rating. Finally, it identifies a number of requirements to be fulfilled to achieve and operationalize the relevance and reliability of stakeholder measurement.},
funding_text 1={but measurements of People and Society Results will follow. The EPSI Rating measurements on customers were designed according to recommendations by a feasibility study (see Sofres, 1996), and by the work provided by the ECSI Technical Committee (see European Customer Satisfaction Index, 1998). Measurements have so far been implemented in just a sample of the European countries, and for a small set of industries. It is owned and managed by the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), by the European Organization for Quality (EOQ), and by the academic network International Foundation for Customer Focus (IFCF). The model is similar to ACSI (see Fig. 6), and through cooperation with ACSI, the intention is gradually to make the models as identical as possible.},

abstract={The Special Climate Change (SCC) fund was established by the Marrakesh Accords under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This fund will finance climate change activities in the areas of: adaptation, technology transfer, certain specific sectors, and activities to assist oil-exporting countries diversify their economies. These activities are to be complementary to those funded by the Global Environment Facility and by bilateral and multilateral funding. This paper describes the origins of the SCC fund and proposes a framework for the prioritisation of its activities. The fund has a complicated history that is intrinsically linked to numerous Convention issues, which explains the range of activities included in it. The framework proposed is based on certain principles: sound scientific knowledge, the ultimate objective of the Convention, “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” and the status of the climate negotiations. This appraisal suggests that the fund should prioritise adaptation, followed by mitigation and finally economic diversification. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper endeavours to present building owners, managers, architects and design/builders with a compelling business case for considering a green building for their new construction projects. A green building, for the purposes of this paper, refers to any building that meets the high standards set forth in the US Green Building Council’s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System™, the pre-eminent metric system by which new buildings are judged to be environmentally conscious. The financial benefits of green buildings are many. They include reduced energy consumption and their associated costs, increased occupant productivity and worker retention, increased market values, and reduced health liability risks due to better indoor air quality. Individual building measures are presented through a tertiary examination of two LEED Certified buildings. These individual benefits are examined further as an integrated building whole, indicating that buildings constructed to LEED standards can save more than 250 per cent of its up-front costs over the course of its 40-year useable life cycle. © 2003, © MCB UP Limited.},

We consider exact and approximate infinite horizon measures based on different strategies for extending the projections past 75 years. These indicate imbalances of 3.1 to 5.7 percent of payroll. We also suggest a simpler common sense measure: the tax increase necessary to make the Trust Fund Ratio equal in the 74th and 75th years. Under the Trustees' mortality projection, it indicates 3.1 percent imbalance, with a more rapid mortality decline of 4.2 percent. All sustainability measures indicate greater imbalance than is currently thought.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To consider the extent, nature, and range of risk arrangements between physician groups and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for self-administered injectable (SAI) drugs; to examine types and frequencies of SAI drug-use management strategies adopted by physician groups; and to explore the relationship between locus and level of financial risk for SAIs and physician group strategy adoption. METHODS: We used a multiple case-study design to select physician groups and their health maintenance organization (HMO) contractual partners in 4 markets in the United States (Northwest, Northeast, Midwest, Southwest). Physician groups in these markets were chosen based on size (e50 physicians) and experience with drug risk (e1 year). Physician groups were asked to identify their 3 major HMO contractual partners in each market. Telephone interviews were conducted from January 2000 to June 2001, with the resulting purposive sample of 37 individuals representing 20 physician groups. RESULTS: We found that the level and locus of SAI financial risk were related to the adoption of management strategies. Physician groups with higher financial risk for SAIs adopted more strategies than lower-risk groups. Groups with SAI financial risk in the medical services capitation (MSC) adopted 9.2 strategies per group. In contrast, groups with SAI financial risk in the pharmacy-risk budget (PRB) averaged 1.5 strategies per group. Groups with SAI financial risk in both the MSC and PRB fell in-between, averaging 4.5 strategies per group. The most frequently adopted strategy was designing evidenced-based therapeutic guidelines, i.e., protocols based on evidence from the peer-reviewed literature used to guide physicians in the treatment of typically chronic conditions (9 groups, 45% of sample). The second most common strategy involved adapting the existing utilization management system to process SAIs (7 groups, 35%) and the establishment of office procedures for internal authorization (5 groups, 25%). The least frequently used strategies were determining amount paid to out-of-group physician providers (1 group, 5%) and hiring personnel (e.g., pharmacists) in claims or utilization management departments to implement and manage SAI programs (1 group, 5%). We also identified potential factors that increased the likelihood of strategy adoption and that could slow the rate of SAI cost increases. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that adoption of SAI drug-use management strategies may be more likely to occur when there is a minimum level of risk for SAI drug costs. Likewise, both the adoption of strategies and the opportunity to slow the rate of SAI cost increases may be more likely to occur when 3 additional factors are present: a contractual environment conducive to controlling SAI drug costs, the ability to implement SAI drug-use management strategies, and power in negotiations with drug manufacturers to reduce SAI prices. A sustainable and affordable SAI financial risk management program maximizing these factors while minimizing the financial burden for patients will require collaboration among all stakeholders, payers, providers, drug manufacturers, and patients.},

abstract={A missing anterior tooth or open embrasures destroys the aesthetics of a smile. The replacement of a missing anterior tooth is one of the most rewarding and challenging aspects of restorative dentistry. There are a number of techniques to do this, however, most involve the use of a technician, which means additional cost to the patient and multiple visits. In today's financial climate with practice expenses climbing and medical aid remuneration dwindling, one must seek methods to reduce costs and provide patients with more affordable dentistry. In addition, in crisis situations such as the traumatic loss of a tooth an immediate replacement technique albeit temporary is necessary. To replace a missing anterior tooth directly and immediately presents a rewarding challenge to the clinician. The Umgeni bridge named after the river that flows on the north side of Durban, is particularly useful in replacing congenitally missing laterals after completion of orthodontic treatment in the case of congenitally missing laterals and cleft palates.},

abstract={Climate change poses a major risk to the global economy. The increasing frequency of severe climatic events, coupled with the unwise nature of economic development, has the potential to create unsustainable levels of damage for the commercial and public financial sectors. The greenhouse gases that create this problem are long lived, so action is urgently needed. The Kyoto Protocol is an important step, but it does not go far enough. A long-term international political framework is required based on the principles of precaution and equity. This can be achieved most effectively through market solutions. The financial sector has a key role to play but there are cognitive, political, analytical and operational barriers. These obstacles can be overcome by creating a focus for key actions, and through close collaboration with policymakers.},

abstract={This paper presents a synthesis of assessment of sustainable biomass production potential in six Asian countries - China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and is based on the detailed studies carried out in these countries under the Asian Regional Research Programme in Energy, Environment and Climate (ARRPEEC). National level studies were undertaken to estimate land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options in terms of yield per hectare and financial viability, estimate sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production in the six Asian countries. Sustainable biomass production from plantation is estimated to be in the range of 182.5-210.5, 62-310, 0.4-1.7, 3.7-20.4, 2.0-9.9 and 11.6-106.6 Mt yr -1 for China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, respectively. The maximum annual electricity generation potential, using advanced technologies, from the sustainable biomass production is estimated to be about 27, 114, 4.5, 79, 254 and 195 percentage of the total electricity generation in year 2000 in China, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand, respectively.

abstract={The Special Climate Change (SCC) fund was established by the Marrakesh Accords under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This fund will finance climate change activities in the areas of: adaptation, technology transfer, certain specific sectors, and activities to assist oil-exporting countries diversify their economies. These activities are to be complementary to those funded by the Global Environment Facility and by bilateral and multilateral funding. This paper describes the origins of the SCC fund and proposes a framework for the prioritisation of its activities. The fund has a complicated history that is intrinsically linked to numerous Convention issues, which explains the range of activities included in it. The framework proposed is based on certain principles: sound scientific knowledge, the ultimate objective of the Convention, "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" and the status of the climate negotiations. This appraisal suggests that the fund should prioritise adaptation, followed by mitigation and finally economic diversification. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study aims to estimate the land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options by yield ha-1 and financial viability, estimate the sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production. Two scenarios are considered to estimate the land availability for biomass production by 2010, namely Scenario 1 (S1) and Scenario 2 (S2). S1 assumes that the land use pattern will remain constant until 2010 while S2 considers the surplus land available and also the projected area under plantation in 2010. Two biomass demand scenarios are also considered, namely incremental biomass demand (IBD) scenario and full biomass demand (FBD) scenario. IBD assumes that only the incremental biomass demand (industrial wood, sawn wood and fuelwood) from 1997 to 2010 will be generated through harvests from new plantation using the available land. FBD assumes that all the biomass demand (fuelwood + sawn wood + industrial wood) projected for the year 2010 will be met from new plantation. Under the IBD scenario, the annual biomass production potential for energy would be 210.47 and 182.53 Mt for S1 and S2, respectively. The surplus area for energy would be 39.64 and 32.51 M ha for S1 and S2, respectively. Under the FBD scenario, the land required for biomass demand would be 99.71 M ha which is larger than the feasible surplus land of 90.73 and 83.60 M ha under S1 and S2, respectively. Therefore, the surplus area for energy is negative, that means the biomass supply by plantation will not be met by full biomass demand in 2010 even if all feasible lands would be developed. Electricity generation potential from plantation under S1 and S2 will supply about 8.8% and 7.6% of total electricity demand, respectively. The plantation cost of major species and the biomass production for energy by plantation in 2010 under these scenarios are also calculated. Investment required for biomass production for energy is projected. Barriers and strategies for biomass production for energy are also discussed in this study. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={This study aims to estimate the land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options by yield per ha and financial viability, estimate the sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production. Two scenarios are proposed to determine the feasible land for biomass production by 2010, namely Scenario 1 (S1) and Scenario 2 (S2). S1 assumes that there will be no increase in the area under food production by 2010 while S2 considers an increase of 10% in the area under food production by 2010. Two biomass demand scenarios are also considered, namely incremental biomass demand (IBD) scenario and full biomass demand (FBD) scenario. The potential land available for biomass production is identified by the use of the Thai Forest Sector Master Plan target area. Under the two scenarios, the land for production of biomass to meet the biomass demands for industrial wood, sawn wood and fuelwood, and the area that can be dedicated for biomass production for bioenergy are estimated. The total potential available for biomass production is 22.5 million ha. The land for production of biomass to meet the demands is 0.512 million ha under the IBD scenario and 6.524 million ha under the FBD scenario. The land dedicated for bioenergy production is 8.329 and 2.911 million ha, respectively for the two scenarios. For the IBD scenario, the land dedicated for bioenergy will be allocated from community forest (CMF) and non-protected area system (NPAS) where both categories are suitable for short rotation plantation or Eucalyptus. For FBD scenario, the land dedicated for bioenergy will be allocated from NPAS only. For IBD scenario, the annual bioenergy production ranges from 106.6 to 33.3 million ton. For FBD scenario, the annual bioenergy production ranges from 37.3 to 11.6 million ton. The potential electricity generation using biomass by 2010 varies from 106.6 to 11.6 TWh.

abstract={This study aims to estimate land availability for biomass production, identify and evaluate the biomass production options in terms of yield per hectare and financial viability, estimate sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production in the Philippines. In estimating the area for biomass production, two land availability scenarios are considered, namely, Scenario 1 (S1) which assumes that there will be no increase in the area under permanent crops, arable lands, forest plantations and agroforestry (AF) lands by 2010 (with 1997 as the base year), and Scenario 2 (S2) which assumes that the total land area under permanent crops, arable lands, forest plantations and AF increases by about 10% by 2010. Three possible scenarios are used to account for the projected biomass demands by the year 2010, namely incremental biomass demand (IBD), sustainable biomass demand (SBD), and full biomass demand (FBD). Under IBD the surplus land for bioenergy plantation would be 1.94 and 1.16 Mha under S1 and S2, respectively. While under SBD, the remaining land for bioenergy plantation is 1.44 and 0.66 Mha under Sland S2, respectively. Because of the high value of biomass requirements, FBD cannot be applied in the country. Therefore under FBD, there will be no land available for bioenergy plantations. Three major forestry options are also considered for bioenergy production: short rotation forest plantation, long rotation forest plantation and AF. The total annual biomass production potential for energy in the country is in the range of 3.7-20.37 Mt under the different scenarios and options. Assuming the energy content of wood is 15 GJt-1, energy potential of the produced biomass is 55.5 million to 305.6 million GJ. If 1 Mt of woody biomass can generate 1 TWh of electrical power, then the annual electricity generation potential also ranges from 3.7 to 20.37 TWh. The potential amount of electricity generated through bioenergy plantation would be from 3% to 22% of the country's projected electricity demand by the year 2008. Barriers and policy options for biomass production for energy are also discussed. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Every clinical project, be it a full development programme or a single clinical trial, has its typical risk factors. Regardless of the complexity of the project, budget overshoot, missed timelines, communication breakdown and staff turnover are often cited as generic project risks. Poor quality usually concludes this list, although it can hardly be separated out as a standalone entity. Project managers should have an insight into the origin of the most common risk factors if they want to be successful. In particular, the first four should be well known to any seasoned project manager as he or she will be the first line of defence for sponsors looking to safeguard the project expectations. Understanding risk factors combined with experience often provides the most powerful risk management tool available - prevention.},

abstract={Over an extended period during the 1990s, using long interviews with the top management of five banks and secondary data, we studied the transformation of Canadian banks. We observed how the Canadian banks have changed to take full advantage of the increased technological potential for developing and exchanging information. The failure of the "pure players" has shown that the information advantages of the Internet are not sufficient to lead to sustainable competitive advantage. Existing financial institutions can make better use of that same information flow by combining it with organizational changes that make the new information more strategically valuable. By aligning information technology and the hard elements of their organizational architecture with soft elements like reputation, cooperation, and information sharing, traditional banks have developed powerful advantages in the 1990s.},

abstract={This paper analyzes financial risks in a market for tradable green certificates (TGC) from two perspectives; existing renewable producers and potential investors in new renewable electricity generation capacity. The equilibrium pricing mechanism for a consumer-based TGC market is described and a market with wind turbines as the sole renewable technology is analyzed. In this framework, TGC prices and fluctuations in production from wind turbines will be negatively correlated and, as a result, TGC price fluctuations can actually help decrease the total financial risk. Based on this recognition, analytical expressions for revenue-variance-minimizing trading strategies are derived and an analysis of the demand and supply for financial hedging is used to show that forward contracts will be traded at a risk premium. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={A broad access to appropriate and sustainable financial services has been pointed out repeatedly to be important for poverty reduction. It contributes to higher income and better food security. Many poor households are faced with transitory food insecurity, even though their incomes seem to provide a sufficient livelihood base over several years. Thus, there is a potential demand for savings, credit, and insurance services to more effectively stabilize consumption and to raise the ability to escape chronic poverty. Hunger eradication and poverty alleviation, particular in the northern uplands, is of enormous concern to the Vietnamese government. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) proposes financial services as a powerful tool for poverty reduction. From the early 1990s onwards, the Vietnamese government has begun to establish and promote formal financial intermediaries (FFIs) such as the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), the Vietnam Bank for the Poor (VBP) and the People's Credit Funds to provide the rural poor with loans. The Vietnam Living Standard Survey 1997-98 shows that FFIs have been very successful in increasing their level of outreach, i.e. the state-owned VBARD and the VBP have reached almost 4.5 million and 2.5 million rural households with credit, respectively. These are more than 58% of all rural households in Vietnam. The majority of the loans to the rural poor is given by the VBP through a group lending scheme. Key objectives of this contribution are (1) to identify crucial gate keepers of important credit information and (2) to describe the formalized and non-formalized information channels and to which extent they reach the target group. Methodologically, this contribution combines secondary data from the FFIs and empirical evidence from the commune and household levels. The qualitative and quantitative data were collected between March and October 2001 in the Ba Be district, Bac Kan province of Northern Vietnam. The information economic analysis of FFIs at the district and provincial level produced insights on policy objectives and formalized procedures of credit fund allocation. The survey comprised 118 households in four villages and three communes of Ba Be district. By way of a so-called 'social mapping', the relationships of members in credit groups was made transparent. Semi-structured interviews with key persons such as mass organization officials, credit officers, credit group leaders and members at the village and commune level provided data on the credit allocation.},

abstract={During its last term, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed its approval of mandatory arbitration in Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams and Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph. The 5-4 votes in these decisions show, however, that this public policy remains controversial. Many firms now require employees to waive their right to sue on employment claims and to submit to their employers' exclusively selected arbitration procedures. Some of these agreements also require employees to pay large sums for arbitrator fees and other forum costs. Having no recourse to sue, these workers are denied access to any dispute resolution forum because they cannot afford arbitration. Courts have begun to scrutinize these barriers only recently. Our Article presents the first empirical research on court enforcement of mandatory arbitration agreements that shift some or all forum and representation costs to employees. Analyzing sixty-two of these federal court decisions - most of which were decided since 1999 - we find that district courts ordered arbitration in 77 percent of cases in which employees objected that arbitration was too costly to be an accessible forum. Only 50 percent of appellate decisions ordered arbitration. These results suggest that even though there is a strong federal policy favoring arbitration of employment disputes, courts do not automatically preclude lawsuits. In particular, if a mandatory arbitration agreement creates a cost barrier to a private dispute resolution process, some courts void the entire agreement or rescind the cost-shifting provision. We observe some preliminary empirical patterns among federal courts. Counting appellate and district decisions equally in each circuit, the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and D.C. Circuits favored arbitration over litigation when cost was asserted as an argument against enforcement of these agreements. In contrast, the First, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits often denied arbitration in cost-challenge cases, thereby clearing the way for employment discrimination lawsuits. The Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits had inconsistent patterns of ordering arbitration. These conflicting trends reflect emerging doctrinal differences. The forum substitution theory holds that employees cannot be compelled to pay more than court filing fees - a nominal sum. In sharp contrast, there is the comparative cost doctrine. According to this view, employees can be required to pay thousands of dollars in arbitration costs. Judges who endorse this theory compare these expenditures to fully litigated disputes, which average about $50,000 in total costs. Precedents are in place to institutionalize these competing doctrines. A January 15, 2002 decision, EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., created a narrow exception to the pro-arbitration rulings in Circuit City and Green Tree, but failed to resolve the developing conflict among the circuits concerning cost-shifting. Thus, a future Supreme Court may need to clarify these fundamental differences in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) perspectives, and judging from the bitter and frustrated tone in Justice Stevens's Circuit City dissent, we believe that four Justices await the opportunity to right some of the wrongs they perceive in mandatory employment arbitration. Our Article also provides important insights to practitioners who draft, implement, or resolve workplace disputes under mandatory arbitration agreements.},

abstract={This study explores learning climates within a financial services organisation. Through the use of survey and case study strategies and analysis of secondary data available within the organisation, it assesses the current state of individual, team and organisational learning in the organisation and the managers’ roles in promoting a learning climate. The conclusions drawn from this research lead to recommendations for a series of actions, which, if adopted, would help to establish the need for a learning climate and a wider and deeper understanding of the nature of learning in the organisation. Initial practical steps are outlined to put into place activities that would add value to the organisation, enhance its learning capabilities and develop its learning climate. Research implications are also discussed. © 2002, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={Global warming mitigation calculations require consistent procedures for handling time in order to compare 'permanent' gains from energy-sector mitigation options with 'impermanent' gains from many forest-sector options. A critical part of carbon accounting methodologies such as those based on 'ton-years' (the product of the number of tons of carbon times the number of years that each ton is held out of the atmosphere) is definition of a time horizon, or the time period over which carbon impacts and benefits are considered. Here a case is made for using a time horizon of 100 years. This choice avoids distortions created by much longer time horizons that would lead to decisions inconsistent with societal behavior in other spheres; it also avoids a rapid increase in the implied value of time if horizons shorter than 100 years are used. Selection of a time horizon affects decisions on financial mechanisms and carbon credit. Simple adaptations can allow a time horizon to be specified and used to calculate mitigation benefits and at the same time reserve a given percentage of weight in decision making for generations beyond the end of the time horizon. The choice of a time horizon will heavily influence whether mitigation options such as avoided deforestation are considered viable.},

abstract={Leadership research to date has mainly focused on leaders' subjective effects. In this study, we examine the effect of different leadership styles on two financial measures of organizational performance and three measures of organizational climate in 50 supermarket stores of a large supermarket chain in the Netherlands. Our findings show a clear relationship of local leadership with the financial performance and organizational climate in the stores. The findings also show that the leadership styles have differential effects. Charismatic leadership and consideration have a substantial effect on climate and financial performance in the small stores, suggesting the relevance of personal leadership of the store manager in these small stores. Initiating structure leadership had no effect on financial results or organizational climate, either in the small stores or in the large stores. Based on these findings, we have formulated some avenues for further research. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper will consider the impact and implications of changing the method of selection for social work students on one BA/Diploma in social work course for mature students with family commitments. The change was instituted following research which suggested that interviewers' preferences were a poor predictor of successful outcome of course completion for students, and further, that other predictors such as quality of written application material and student motivation were factors which had a strong correlation with successful outcome. Consequently, in 1999, selecting students by interview was replaced by paper selection. While it is the long-term aim of academic staff to evaluate the merits of paper selection in terms of students' outcomes, this initial paper considers the organisational and administrative implications of changing to paper selection and the students' and selectors' perceptions of paper selection. In particular, this paper will consider whether it is possible to be objective in selecting applicants, or whether subjectivity will always be part of the process. Finally, the article considers the relative cost of paper selection as opposed to interview. The findings of this study suggest that interviewing is twice as costly on academic and agency staff time - a factor which in the present financial climate has considerable implications for the future of interviewing on social work courses. © 2002, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The increasing gap between the supply and demand for water in the Economic and Social Commission of Western Asia (ESCWA) member countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen) can be attributed to the limited availability of surface water, mining of fossil groundwater sources, and water pollution mainly of shallow aquifers, deficient institutional structure, poor management processes, and inapt allocation of financial resources. The non-sustainable use of natural water resources to meet the escalating water demand has also contributed to the depletion and deterioration of water quality and quantity. To meet water supply shortages in the domestic sector, water desalination has been entrenched as a viable option for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes the following countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. The objective of the paper is to investigate the role of water desalination in meeting the water demands in the ESCWA member countries. The significant role of desalination is highlighted with emphasis in evaluating not only its production trends, processes, and costs, but also its capacity in the provision of water demands. Water desalination has become a major and staunch water source for a number of large urban centers. For such countries such as Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar and the coastal zone areas of Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia, desalination represents one of the most feasible and strategic alternative options for their current and future domestic water supply requirement. Given the high consumption rate from this source and its high production cost, fundamental efforts must be integrated and invested in both research and development programs to implement comprehensive conservation measures that would lead to a reduction in the consumption rates. Parallel to these achievements, efforts should be directed within the context of integrated management of water resources, to identify alternative potential water resources, to meet future water challenges.},

abstract={This paper provides an overview of the history of formal sector micro finance services, and examines the demand for and supply of micro finance in Sri Lanka. It also identifies the sources of funds of Micro Finance Institutions (MFI), examines the constraints and prospects of such institutions and reviews the role of government and other agencies in facilitating a viable and sustainable micro finance sector in the country. The paper shows that micro finance sector in Sri Lanka suffers from inadequate capacity of MFI's, lack of proper financial structure and the defects of the regulatory framework among other things. Support is needed in the areas of training and technical assistance, regulatory and supervisory system development, modification of legal framework, development of financial infrastructure and above all policy support rather than providing funds for on lending purposes.},

Highly readable his examination of Elizabeth I from the perspective of a business leader and manager contains several strategic lessons that librarians and especially financial managers can apply to stay viable in our current political and financial climate. Whether from the public or private library viewpoint the two reviewers of this work remark that there is much to be gleaned from Elizabeth I's aggressive leadership style and political acumen which is relevant in managing today's libraries. While there is nothing new in the information presented the fresh approach interesting reading and use of a historical figure to examine today's issues drive home important tenets which the head of any successful organization not only needs to know but also must practice. © 2001, MCB UP Limited},

abstract={Funding for greenhouse gas mitigation projects in developing countries is crucial for addressing the global climate change problem. By examining current climate change-related financial mechanisms and their limitations, this paper indicates that their roles are limited in affecting developing countries' future emissions, and argues for the necessity of stronger private sector engagement in financing mitigation projects. In this regard, the clean development mechanism (CDM), one of the flexibility mechanisms incorporated into the Kyoto Protocol, could offer great potential in helping mobilize foreign direct investment towards climate mitigation, by providing commercial incentives for the private sector to invest in mitigation projects and internalizing externalities associated with mitigation projects. However, due to additional risks and barriers involved in CDM projects, we believe that appropriate public-private linkage would be necessary in order to bring the CDM into full play. To this end, we suggest that public funds could be used to complement private investment via the CDM, thus enhancing market functions of such an investment. Moreover, in so doing, we think that it would be necessary to examine a host of factors, such as risk sharing, private sector investment behaviour, types of technologies to be transferred. and co-ordination with the commonly practiced trade and investment rules. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={This paper aims to examine major regional innovation strategies for regional development in the knowledge-based economy in Korea. Innovation policy and Regional Innovation Systems (RIS) are becoming important issues in Korea in both national and regional perspectives. These issues have been evolving since the mid 1990s, especially since the financial crisis of 1997 in Korea. Five major policy issues for promoting innovation and regional competitiveness are examined in this paper. The major policy issues are: promoting region-specific clustering; building habitats for innovation and entrepreneurship; collective learning processes and innovation networks; building a stock of social capital; and promoting local and global networks. Several strategies are suggested for each of these policy issues. These major policy issues and related strategies for regional innovation and competitiveness can be regarded as common issues required for the successful development of RIS. Taking these basic policy issues into account, each region can develop their own region-specific RIS, with appropriate consideration of distinctive regional characteristics such as the level of development, industrial specialization, local labor market, local business climate, local financial system, etc.},

abstract={Evidence of the challenge faced by the meteorological community to become skilled in applying risk management products from the financial markets is growing. This paper presents an approach to the pricing of weather derivatives that employs a combination of empirical data including forecast verification data, regional synoptic classification data, and data associated with climate indices on a global scale, such as the Southern Oscillation Index. The paper presents several illustrative examples that show how to price these options about the occurrence of an unusual weather event, using forecast verification data and synoptic classification data.},

It is treated a large number of variables which belong to ten broad cathegories: trade policy, taxation, government interventions in economy, monetary policy, capital flows and foreign investment policy, banking, price and wages control, property rights, regulations and black market. The conclusion of the analysis is evident. Bosnia and Herzegovina is still faced with great challenges, but the country is making progress in many spheres of reform. Great efforts are made in improvement of legal and macroeconomic climate. Financial sector is in a phase of reform and privatization is underway. New political structures are strengthening. Serious and violent criminal actions decrease. Internal movement of commodities and people has been again established. Price inflation and public consuption are to a large extent under control. © 2001, Hrvatsko Drustvo Ekonomista. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to explore indicators for sustainable financial schemes in rural areas and to evaluate such schemes in terms of their contribution to rural community development. During the 1970's, when economic development was recognised to be the dominant paradigm, scant attention was often given to non-economic benefits of financial incentives in rural areas. This paper argues that rural financial schemes are often evaluated with quantitative criteria in spite of profound non-economic benefits such schemes have for community development. Evidence are presented from success stories in the developing world and fieldwork done in South Africa which reveal that successful rural financing are often determined by indicators of a qualitative nature.},

abstract={How can financial sector reform be designed specifically so that it enhances the prospects for sustainable development? This paper begins an analysis of this little-discussed intersection, with a focus on the problems and possibilities facing Costa Rica. Policy changes that encourage financial markets to incorporate long-term environmental sustainability concerns will require moving beyond a standard model of financial liberalization. Flighty financial flows, systemic pressures against innovation, and unpriced environmental externalities all mean that real sector environmental performance will be adversely affected by financial sector dynamics, lacking appropriate policy markers. Financial market policies must encourage market forces to channel capital flows that build productive capabilities based on complementarities between development and environmental quality. Costa Rica's reform process and unusual depth of experience in pursuing sustainable development make it an ideal place for such financial market innovations to be attempted. Getting its incentive system right in financial restructuring could aid immensely in the emergence and application of sustainability-based competitive capabilities. A set of market-based 'green' financial reforms is proposed, including tax-advantaged banking and bond programs, rural group lending, and a single certification entity for potential borrowers in these programs. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={There has been increasing pressure on farmers in Europe to reduce the emissions of ammonia from their land. Due to the current financial climate in which farmers have to operate, it is important to identify ammonia control measures that can be adopted with minimum cost. The planting of trees around farmland and buildings has been identified as a potentially effective and low-cost measure to enhance ammonia recapture at a farm level and reduce long-range atmospheric transport. This work assesses experimentally what fraction of ammonia farm woodlands could potentially remove from the atmosphere. We constructed an experimental facility in southern Scotland to simulate a woodland shelterbelt planted in proximity to a small poultry unit. By measuring horizontal and vertical ammonia concentration profiles within the woodland, and comparing this to the concentration of an inert tracer (SF6) we estimate the depletion of ammonia due to dry deposition to the woodland canopy. Together with measurements of mean ammonia concentrations and throughfall fluxes of nitrogen, this information is used to provide a first estimate of the fraction of emitted ammonia that is recaptured by the woodland canopy. Analysis of these data give a lower limit of recapture of emitted ammonia, at the experimental facility, of 3%. By careful design of shelterbelt woodlands this figure could be significantly higher.},

abstract={Current worldwide competitive conditions mandate lower cost, higher efficiency and more consistent quality. Optimising process control will contribute to accomplishing these objectives. However, without knowledge on the performance of the assets in the plant, process control optimisation cannot return the improvements needed. The field based architecture provides the opportunity to determine current levels of performance and theoretical performance. In addition, it provides the capability to continuously monitor performance, isolate problems, and determine root causes in a more cost effective way than conventional architectures can provide. This combination of capability means that the field based architecture can provide sustainable performance and financial advantages over conventional architectures.},

abstract={In recent years, it has become increasingly common for lenders to include arbitration clauses in their consumer financing agreements. While federal law strongly supports the enforceability of arbitration provisions, there are a number of grounds on which their enforceability can be, and has been, challenged. This article summarizes the state of the law on a number of major issues which have arisen in the attempt to use arbitration clauses in consumer financing agreements, focusing on Truth-in-Lending Act claims, including an analysis of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Randolph.},

See Alllied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (holding that the FAA was intended to apply broadly, to the limits of Congress's commerce power); Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 15-16, 104 S.Ct. 852, 860-61, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (holding that the FAA pre-empts state law). Given the broad scope that has been given to interstate commerce, most consumer financing agreements probably fall within this category. If the parties desire, the arbitration clause itself may provide that it shall be interpreted under the FAA, increasing the chances that federal law will apply; 4 9 U.S.C. § 2; Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v.

Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943,115 S.Ct. 1920, 1924, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995) ("arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a way to resolve those disputes -but only those disputes - that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration"); See, e.g., Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 105 F.3d 1147 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 808, 118 S.Ct. 47, 139 L.Ed.2d 13 (1997); Harris v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 183 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 1999); Marsh v.

Supp.2d 582 (D.S.C. 1998) (employment law claims), aff'd, 173 F.3d 933 (4th Cir. 1999); Even if a transaction involves interstate commerce, and the arbitration clause is therefore to be handled under the FAA, the validity of consent to the arbitration clause is tested under state law according to the same principles that the state uses to test the validity of any other contract provision. See, e.g., Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996). The construction and effect of the arbitration clause, however, is a matter of federal law. See Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 25 n.32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). If the parties consented to the arbitration provision, then questions going to the validity of the entire contract, such as allegations of fraud, may themselves be subject to determination by the arbitrator. See Prima Paint Corp v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967); See, e.g., Williams v. Aetna Fin. Co., 83 Ohio St.3d 464, 700 N.E.2d 859 (1998) (reasoning that arbitration agreement in an adhesion contract "necessarily engenders more reservations than an arbitration clause in a different setting, such as in a collective bargaining agreement, a commercial contract between two businesses, or a brokerage agreement"), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1051, 119 S.Ct. 1357, 143 L.Ed.2d 518 (1999); Iwen v. U.S. W. Direct, 977 P.2d 989 (Mont. 1999) ("[w]hen determining whether a contract is one of adhesion, we focus on the nature of the contracting process, rather than the parties' relative sizes, resources, or bargaining power. Hence, we have held that contracts of adhesion arise when a standardized form of agreement, usually drafted by the party having superior bargaining power, is presented to a party, whose choice is either to accept or reject the contract without the opportunity to negotiate its terms." [internal quotes and cites omitted]); See, e.g., Marsh, 103 F.Supp.2d at 920 (stating that a claim of unconscionability must show that the contract was "so one sided as to be oppressive");; See, e.g., Hull v. Norcom, Inc., 750 F.2d 1547 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding arbitration clause unenforceable for lack of mutuality where one side reserved option to bring majority of its claims to court); See, e.g., Dorsey v. H.C.P. Sales, Inc., 46 F.Supp.2d 804 (N.D. Ill. 1999); Goodwin v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 970 F. Supp. 1007 (M.D. Ala. 1997); Worldwide Ins. Group v.

Va. 1998) (holding "that where an arbitration agreement entered into as part of a consumer loan transaction contains a substantial waiver of the borrower's rights, including access to the courts, while preserving the lender's right to a judicial forum, the agreement is unconscionable and, therefore, void and unenforceable as a matter of law."); See, e.g., Harris v.

Best Buy Co., Inc., 75 F.Supp.2d 1368 (S.D.Fla. 1999) (holding that an arbitration provision that requires each party to bear its own legal fees, thereby eliminating the statutory right to seek legal fees after prevailing under a TILA claim, renders arbitration clause unconscionable); but see Dorsey v. HCP Sales, Inc., 46 F.Supp.2d 804, 808 (N.D.Ill. 1999) (arbitration of TILA and state laws claims compelled despite allegedly excessive costs); Rhode v. E & T Investments, Inc., 6 F.Supp.2d 1322, 1328 (M.D. Ala. 1; See, e.g., Hooters of America, Inc. v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933 (4th Cir. 1999); Cheng-Canindin v. Renaissance Hotel Associates, 57 Cal.

Ryan's Family Steakhouses, Inc., 235 Mich.App. 118, 596 N.W.2d 208 (Mich. App. 1999) (to be fair and enforceable, an arbitration agreement must provide for (1) clear notice; (2) right to counsel; (3) reasonable discovery; (4) a fair hearing; and (5) a neutral arbitrator.); 178 F.3d at 1158; 102 F.Supp.2d at 1352; note; 121 S.Ct. at 519-21. The issue here was whether an order compelling arbitration and dismissing all claims is a final order in an "embedded proceeding" B that is, a suit including both a request for arbitration and other claims for relief. Some Circuit Courts had held that an order compelling arbitration is final in an "independent proceeding" B where no relief beyond the arbitration order is sought B but not in embedded proceedings, even if all other claims are dismissed. See, e.g., Seacoast Motors of Salisbury, Inc., v. Chrysler Corp. 143 F.3d 626 (1st Cir. 1998); Altman Nursing, Inc. v. Clay Capital Corp., 84 F.3d 769 (5th Cir. 1996); Gammaro v. Thorp Consumer Discount Co., 15 F.3d 93 (8th Cir. 1994); See 9 U.S.C. A. section 16(a)(1)(C): "An appeal may be taken from B (1) an order...(C) denying an application under section 206 of this title to compel arbitration..."; 121 S.Ct. at 522; Id; Id. [internal quotes and citations omitted]; Id. at 524. For example, the American Arbitration Association handles consumer cases valued under $10,000 under its Arbitration Rules for the Resolution of ConsumerRelated Disputes, which require no fee from the consumer and limit the consumer's share of the arbitrator's fees to $125. In Dobbins v. Hawk's Enterprises, 198 F.3d 715 (8th Cir. 1999), the district court had permitted a TILA suit to continue despite an arbitration clause, on grounds that plaintiff could not afford the AAAs fee determination of $23,000. The Circuit Court reversed, holding that the plaintiff had not fully explored the AAA's fee waiver procedures, and that the fee determination was based on the plaintiff's damage claim of $50 million and would be much less if a "more realistic" damage figure were used. Thus, the court remanded with orders that the plaintiff be ordered to reduce its demand for damages and seek diminution or waiver of the AAA fee; Id. at 522; The Supreme Court expressly declined to address the issue in Green Tree v. Randolph, holding that it did not have to rule on an issue not addressed by the Court of Appeals below. 121 S.Ct. at 523 n.7. As noted in the dissent, however, the issue remains alive on remand. Id. at 525 n.4; See Blue Cross of Cal. v. Superior Court, 67 Cal.App.4th 42, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 779 (1998); Dickler v. Shearson Lehman, Inc. 408 Pa. Super. 286, 596 A.2d 860 (1991); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F.3d 269, 275 (7th Cir. 1995) (internal quotes and citation omitted). See also Randolph v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 991 F.Supp. 1410 (M.D. Ala. 1997) (class will not be certified where arbitration clause does not provide for class-wide arbitration); Gammaro v. Thorp Consumer Discount Co., 828 F.

Providential Corp., 1994 WL 387852 (N.D.Cal. 1994), app. dism'd, 122 F.3d 1242 (9th Cir. 1997); but see New England Energy, Inc. v. Keystone Shipping Co., 855 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1077, 109 S.Ct. 1527, 103 L.Ed.2d 832 (1989) (holding that district court may order consolidated arbitration, even though not expressly authorized by parties' agreement, if underlying state law specifically authorizes consolidated arbitration); Cases refusing to enforce mandatory arbitration that would preclude a class action proceeding include Lozada v. Dale Baker Oldsmobile, Inc., 91 F.Supp.2d 1087 (W.D. Mich. 2000) (TILA claims); In re Knepp, 229 B.R. 821 (Bankr. N.D.Ala. 1999); Powertel, Inc. v. Bexley, 743 So.2d 570 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1999) (breach of contract and deceptive trade practices claims). Cases enforcing arbitration clauses despite the effect of precluding a class action include Johnson v. West Suburban Bank, 225 F.3d 366 (3d Cir. 2000) (TILA and Electronic Funds Transfer Act claims); Marsh v. First USA Bank, N.A., 103 F.Supp.2d 909 (N.D.Tex. 2000) (TILA claims); Thompson v.

Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985) (holding that "that the Arbitration Act requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel, even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums."); Cf C. Itoh & Co. (America) v. Jordan International Co., 552 F.2d 1228, 1231 (7th Cir. 1977) ("[c]onsiderations of judicial economy bear no relation to 'the making and performance of an agreement to arbitrate,' and to permit a district court to deny a stay pending arbitration based on such discretionary considerations would, in our opinion, frustrate the strong federal policy in favor of arbitration which is expressed in the Federal Arbitration Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court")},

Indirectly, it could discourage financial speculation and currency crises with their devastating effects on countries; directly, as a tax whose proceeds could be used as an alternative source of sustainable development finance in order to promote the establishment of international public goods. The original Tobin tax proposal can be turned into a feasible instrument by engineering it as a two-tier tax (the so-called Spahn version of the Tobin tax), with the tax being collected through an international settlements systems. A concrete scheme along these lines is proposed.},

abstract={The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and its possible greenhouse effect on global climate has become one of today's major environmental issues. Utility/coal companies which produce high levels of carbon dioxide are interested in mitigating their emissions by sequestering carbon in trees. This study proposed to investigate the amount of money that utility companies would have to pay private forest landowners to sequester additional tonnes of carbon in their forests. Analyses were conducted to calculate the annual financial compensation/incentives necessary to (1) compensate forest landowners who apply economically sub-optimal rotations to sequester maximum carbon; or (2) motivate private landowners to convert unstocked lands into productive forest lands to sequester carbon. Biological and financial analyses were conducted using Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) on a range of site indices. Applying the Faustmann formula, the amount of necessary compensation/incentive was calculated as the difference between the soil expectation value (SEV) of the economically optimal rotation and the SEV of the biologically optimal rotation which maximizes mean annual increment (MAI) of sawtimber and, therefore, maximizes carbon stored in the forest and in the long-lived wood products. Results indicate that the carbon sequestration difference between the MAI of the optimal economic rotation and that of the optimal carbon rotation may be up to 0.79 t of carbon per hectare. Planting unstocked land may store an additional 1.03-3.77 t of carbon per hectare per year. The annual compensation values tend to increase as real interest rates increase. The minimum annual compensation is $0.84 per hectare using an interest rate of 2.5% on site index 50 land. The maximum annual compensation is $72.79 per hectare using an interest rate of 12.5% on site index 90 land. The average costs of sequestering an additional tonne of carbon on lands already intensively managed vary from $4.18 to $181.27. The average costs of sequestering an additional tonne of carbon on unstocked land range from $0.74 to $27.32. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={The proposed Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol paves the way for financial and technological transfers to support forestry projects that sequester carbon or protect carbon stocks. From its inception, the concept has been highly controversial. It has been enthusiastically supported by those who believe that conservation of tropical forests will be difficult unless forest owners and managers are compensated for the environmental services of their forests. Others believe that financial transfers supporting 'carbon farming' would ignore social concerns and the full range of goods and services of forests. This paper examines the implications of CDM for forest conservation and sustainable use, by drawing on recent literature and the results of a policy dialogue with CDM stakeholders. We conclude that initial estimates of the contribution tropical forestry could make to both climate change mitigation and to forest conservation need to be scaled down. CDM payments for tropical forestry are likely to be received in a far more limited area than initially expected. The cost-effectiveness of forestry projects relative to projects in the energy sector may have been overestimated. In particular few estimates have adequately accounted for the likelihood that the duration of CDM forestry projects is unlikely to be as long as the residency time of carbon in the atmosphere. Also political realities and investor priorities may not have been sufficiently understood. CDM funding for forestry may also decline in future as economically viable clean technologies are increasingly developed in the energy sector. Tropical forests are likely to be an intermediate climate change mitigation strategy for buying time, until more permanent options become available. The most important justification for including forests in CDM may lie in the contribution CDM could potentially make to forest conservation and sustainable use. An analysis of the implications of CDM for forests reveals the importance of involving forest stakeholders more closely in the CDM debate. To prevent perverse outcomes and reduce the risk of 'leakage' of emission reduction to areas outside project boundaries, CDM projects may need to be limited to niches which meet certain political and institutional preconditions and where sufficient understanding of local decision-making and the broader context is available, CDM may be more effective if used to remove non-economic impediments to forestry activities that are economically viable and meet local needs. Lessons from the forestry sector in relation to plantations, natural forest management, forest conservation and non-timber forest products are discussed to illustrate the dangers of misusing CDM and also to give examples of how CDM could be harnessed for better use of forests. CDM should be seen as one more tool for enhancing the effectiveness of more conventional ways of promoting forest conservation and sustainable use.},

abstract={The current expansion in micro-finance programmes targeting women is dominated by the 'financial self-sustainability paradigm' aimed at developing programmes which will ultimately be independent of donor funds. Evidence from Asia and Africa indicates that although to some extent empowerment aims can be integrated into financial sustainability 'Best Practice', there are also serious tensions. Increasing contribution of micro-finance to women's empowerment will require a more participatory approach to programme management and linking grassroots groups with other women's organizations. These in turn will require changes in current donor priorities and procedures both in relation to micro-finance itself and to macro-level economic and social policy.},

The typical utility in the future offers an all utility needs and numerous other services to enhance customers' lives. Improved customer service will require a better educated and technically skilled workforce, who will also be more multiculturally diverse. Total quality management is also taking hold in the water profession and will affect management style and organizational culture in the new millennium. Another driver to change will be the need to have sufficient and sustainable technical, managerial, and financial resources to meet the capacity provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The financial issues the new century will present to utilities are also discussed.},

abstract={New Labour is keen to use legislation to encourage what are seen as desirable family practices, and to discourage other, less-favoured, forms. What this means in policy terms has now been codified in its 1998 Green Paper, Supporting Families. In this paper, we examine the validity of this enterprise in terms of its underlying assumptions about social behaviour and economic decision making. We argue that the government implicitly assumes a universal model of ‘rational economic man’ and his close relative the ‘rational legal subject’, whereby people take individualistic, cost–benefit type decisions about how to maximize their own personal gain. Change the financial structure of costs and benefits, and the legal structure of rights and duties, in the appropriate way and people will modify their social behaviour in the desired direction. However, recent research suggests that people do not act like rational economic man in making decisions about their moral economy. Legislation based on this assumption might then be ineffectual and the proposals in Supporting Families seem to be one example. This is what we have labelled the ‘rationality mistake’. In Part I of this work, we focus on the financial proposals in the Green Paper and on the New Deal for Lone Parents in particular. We then go on to counterpose this with the results of recent empirical work on how and why people actually do make family decisions. In Part II, to be published in the next issue, we focus on chapter four of Supporting Families, on strengthening marriage, and again compare New Labour’s proposals with recent empirical work. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

abstract={Economic systems at all levels rely for their success on the value of services flowing from the stock of total assets which comprise five types of capital: natural, social, human, physical and financial. Sustainable systems accumulate stocks of these five assets, so increasing the capital base over time. But unsustainable systems deplete or run down capital, spending assets as if they were income, and so leaving less for future generations. Modern agriculture has diminished these assets whilst increasing productivity, imposing external costs on many sectors. In the meantime, the food system has become increasingly globalized, bringing with it concerns about new inequities. Alternatives, however, are arising, with a range of approaches available for taking some of the value in food systems back to rural communities and people. Five options are discussed in the paper: 1) adopt sustainable agriculture; 2) sell direct to consumers; 3) enhance links with community co-operatives; 4) organize into farmers' groups; and 5) encourage ecolabelling and traceability. The challenge is to find ways of integrating all of these in supportive policy frameworks. Two examples of improvements in Toronto and Hartford are discussed in detail.},

Ajzen's (1991) theory of planned behavior and Jones's (1991) moral intensity construct grounded our theoretical framework. Findings revealed that the magnitude of consequences, a dimension of moral intensity, moderated the relationships between each of five antecedents - attitudes, subjective norms, and three perceived behavioral control factors (self-efficacy, financial cost, and ethical climate) -and managers' environmental ethical decision intentions. We then developed implications for theory and practice in environmental ethical decision making.},

This article examines a number of issues concerning the extension of palliative care to this patient population. It considers the needs of non-cancer patients, palliative care responsibilities, resource implications, professional knowledge and responsibilities, and possible action. Recommendations include the need for further research to explore these patients' needs and the role of specialist palliative care services. Suggestions regarding how Macmillan nurses could respond to the increased demand for palliative care services are offered. Within the current financial climate, the only realistic response for the Macmillan nurse is to act as a consultant working in collaboration with other health professionals outside the palliative care specialty.},

abstract={The paper is an attempt to revisit the practice of cost recovery in the context of urban low-income housing. The discourse begins by outlining the arguments for cost recovery in low-income housing projects. The discussion acknowledges that the principle of cost recovery is central to the establishment of replicable housing projects and sustainable housing finance systems. The paper then explores the salient issues in the principle of cost recovery. These are explored from the standpoint of the financier and the borrower. It is pointed out that the financier has obligations and responsibilities to depositors and shareholders. The paper then argues that awareness of obligations and responsibilities should be accompanied by practices and procedures that institutionalise and promote cost recovery. Regarding the borrowers the paper highlights the importance of their circumstances within the broader macro-economic sphere. It is then argued that the mode of cost recovery as reflected in the terms of repayment should as much as possible suit the situation and requirements of both the borrower and the lender. The discussion then introduces the role of 'outsiders' in cost recovery and how politicians and busybodies can frustrate the efforts of the financier to recover funds invested in housing. The implications of cost recovery are then drawn out. In this case replicability and investor confidence are emphasised. The results of obsessions with cost recovery are also outlined. These points are then illustrated by examples from urban low-income housing in Zimbabwe. The study concludes by cautioning that the critical issues involved in cost recovery are not exclusively financial, technical and managerial. Most of the crucial issues relate institutional practices and procedures in the face of a multiplicity of direct and indirect stakeholders involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={In this paper we report on what 'sustainable agriculture' means to farmers who seek to develop more sustainable farming systems. Group interviews were conducted with two groups of sustainable farmers in Kansas to learn how they developed their respective approaches, the kinds of parameters they have used to evaluate success and progress, and what other evaluation tools would be helpful to them. For the farmers we interviewed, the central meaning of sustainable agriculture is its holistic approach to assets management. It also means an alternative perspective on what constitutes success in farming. While economic considerations are important, they are balanced by other considerations such as environmental quality, quality of life, and the contributions the farmers can make to their communities. Sustainable agriculture also means an approach to agriculture that entails 'thinking risks' as much as financial risks. Lastly, sustainable agriculture means whole farm planning; the farmers we interviewed were more interested in applying whole-farm planning principles based on their local knowledge, than in evaluation tools based on the expert knowledge of researchers and other scientists. The implications of what sustainable agriculture means to these farmers for research and educational programs are discussed.},

abstract={Development enthusiasts are at crossroads with regard to rural finance in low-income countries. Experience has led to a sharp turn from supply led finance to developing sustainable financial intermediaries. Having encountered many, detrimental and costly failures with the supply led approach, there is excitement following emerging successes of the 'new approach'. There are several success stories documented from Asia, however these are not replicable in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper presents an emerging sound model of an RFI in the region, i.e. a model built by The Kilimanjaro Co-operative Bank of 1995 and Savings and Credit Co-operatives Societies (The KCB-SACCOS model) in Northern Tanzania. The KCB-SACCOS model has managed to overcome difficulties that have led to failures of former rural financial institutions. The successes of the KCB-SACCOS model are attributed to its foundational basis and key operational features. It is an organisation that originates from the grassroots. There is also a strong sense of ownership by the 'client-owner', democratic leadership at SACCOS and a sound SACCOS' representation at the KCB policy body. SACCOS act as strategic nodes of a web to reach a wide client base. The KCB-SACCO model has strategically tapped on the coffee economy and fits well within the socio-economic milieu of the local people and makes use of principles found in the local informal financial practices. The paper elaborates on these features and draws lessons for one approach to develop sustainable rural financial institutions in sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract={The environmental service provided by the great biodiversity of Amazonian forests is one of several factors leading to the conclusion that much greater efforts are warranted to reduce the destruction of these forests. Risks to biodiversity in Amazonian forests include deforestation, logging, fires, fragmentation, depletion of fauna, invasion by exotic species, and climate change. Financial values assigned to biodiversity depend strongly on the purposes of valuation. Utilitarian benefits include the values of presently-marketed and presently-unexploited forest products, and the monetary value of environmental benefits. Non-monetary values of Amazonian forests are also essential components of decision-making on conservation. Measures of 'willingness to pay' and 'willingness to accept' can be useful as indicators of potential financial flows, but should not be confused with the true values of the forests to society. Valuation for the purpose of setting penalties for destruction of biodiversity is an important legal question in Brazil and must take into consideration additional factors. Conservation of biodiversity in Brazil includes creation of various types of protected areas. The status of these areas varies greatly, with practice frequently deviating from official requirements. Creating reserves that include human occupants has a variety of pros and cons. Although the effect of humans is not always benign, much larger areas can be brought under protection regimes if human occupants are included. Additional considerations apply to buffer zones around protected areas. The choice and design of reserves depends on the financial costs and biodiversity benefits of different strategies. In Brazil, rapid creation of lightly-protected 'paper parks' has been a means of keeping ahead of the advance of barriers to establishment of new conservation units, but emphasis must eventually shift to better protection of existing reserves. Indigenous peoples have the best record of maintaining forest, but negotiation with these peoples is essential in order to ensure maintenance of the large areas of forest they inhabit. The benefits of environmental services provided by the forest must accrue to those who maintain these forests. Development of mechanisms to capture the value of these services will be a key factor affecting the longterm prospects of Amazonian forests. However, many effective measures to discourage deforestation could be taken immediately through government action, including levying and collecting taxes that discourage land speculation, changing land tenure establishment procedures so as not to reward deforestation, revoking remaining incentives, restricting road building and improvement, strengthening requirements for environmental impact statements (RIMAs) for proposed development projects, and creating employment alternatives.},

abstract={Of Azerbaijan's 7,564,800 inhabitants, 52.2% live in urban and 47.8% in rural areas. With the transition to market-oriented economy health problems have worsened. Expenditures for health care fell from 2.9% of GDP in 1990 to 1.2% in 1997. In case of ilness, 37% of population prefer self-treatment, and 68% of treatment refusals are due to the inability of patients to pay for the treatment. Maternal mortality rate increased from 10.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1991 to 52 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1996. However diphteria has been reduced to sporadic cases, whereas polio has not been reported since 1996. A pilot reform of primary health care was initiated in one of the districts, and soon expanded to four more districts. The aims were the improvement of health management, rationalization/optimization through development of traditional services, organization of preventative activities, rational use of drugs, institution of sustainable financial mechanisms through affordable fees for services, drug sales within health facilities with corresponding management and the accounting systems for the revenues, development of the exemption system, and community participation in district health. Increased patient attendance to health facilities, improved access to the vulnerable population health services, empowered health system management, better quality of care, and reduced overall individual expenditures were observed.},

abstract={Although the issues of sustainable tourism and sustainable development are receiving increasing attention from tourists, government planners and scholars, few studies have examined their overlap, tensions and complex linkages in practice. In southern Thailand, the sustainability of tourism, defined as the ongoing growth and survival of the tourism industry, has compromised the ecological sustainability of key tourism destinations sites. The recent financial crisis has forced the Thai government to sacrifice long-term sustainability for the sake of quick, and desperately needed foreign exchange. The 'Amazing Thailand' promotional campaign, which aims to attract 17 million tourists over 1998 and 1999, promises to exacerbate further the environmental degradation of tourism destinations in southern Thailand by pushing for enhanced tourist numbers. Ironically, by changing the composition of tourist arrivals (and in particular, attracting more European and North American tourists) the currency devaluations associated with the Asian financial crisis may simultaneously boost demand for nature-based tourist activities in southern Thailand while also adding stress to ecologically deteriorating destinations.},

abstract={This paper describes an exploratory study of financial reporting practices amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in manufacturing in Australia. Non-linear principal components analysis is employed in empirical derivation of an overall measure of the comprehensiveness of financial reporting practices undertaken in the SMEs investigated. Non-linear principal components analysis is also used in empirically capturing the business context in terms of enterprise and financial management characteristics. Polytomous logistic regression modelling reveals development orientation, extent of owner-management, technological complexity, degree of reliance upon external financial advice, and the financial reporting climate to be the most significant influences on the extent of financial reporting practices in the SMEs under study. Of the business context factors identified, development orientation and financial reporting climate seem to have greatest impact. The study appears to reinforce the impression that SME growth is a key driver towards more sophisticated financial reporting practices. Alternately, better financial reporting may be viewed as an important enabling factor in realising the growth aspirations of such concerns.},

abstract={It is now accepted that past and current development strategies among Basarwa communities in Botswana have been unable to satisfactorily achieve the objectives of improving incomes, employment and general quality of life. While these objectives remain of critical importance, there is an urgent need to determine more effective ways that can make them realisable. Basing its argument on the original objectives of the Remote Area Development Programme (RADP), this paper suggests the need for modification and application of new alternative strategies to suit the prevailing circumstances of the Basarwa. From its inception, RADP has been criticised, mainly on the grounds that it has been undertaken by the government with only limited community involvement. This has contributed to a dependency on government support rather than to a momentum of self-standing, sustainable improvements (Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, 1997). Community Economic Development (CED) proposed in this paper draws lessons from general failures of RADP and builds on its strengths. Its main argument is that it is necessary to continually review approaches to development of Basarwa communities with a view to overcoming past short-comings and establishing more effective strategies for the future.},

abstract={In the present climate of financial restrictions, the importance of identifying those buildings that are of greatest value has increased. Identification necessitates knowledge, not only of the architectural and historic worth of a building, but also of its role and contribution to the history and landscape of its location. This paper aims to demonstrate the relevance of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in aiding historic research and analysis of vernacular architecture. Related work in the development of GIS technology to assist in reconstructing and visualizing historical geography has been described by Southall 1 and the role of GIS in managing and analysing spatial data in the field of archaeology has also been well documented. 2 By using a Unix-based Arc/Info GIS and incorporating geo-referenced spatial and textual data, a more comprehensive and contextual method of recording buildings can be developed. This allows better informed judgements to be made when evaluating individual buildings or preparing conservation strategies. © 1999, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Residency training in New York State was substantially altered by the Libby Zion case. Work-hour limitations and augmented supervisory requirements changed the patterns of training - particularly in internal medicine - but with uncertain impacts on the quality of education and patient care. In this historical analysis, we review another major effect of the case: a substantial augmentation of the number of trainees. The need to maintain adequate inpatient staffing - within the ground rules of the Residency Review Committee, and in consideration of the reimbursement formulae and financial climate of New York State - conspired to promote substantial residency program expansion. Similar forces contributed to a national trend to increase the number of trainees. The history, cost and impact of these personnel changes are reviewed.},

abstract={The continued growth in road traffic levels and car use has led to a growing concern about the funding of road transport schemes and a recognition that there is a requirement to manage existing roads more efficiently. This paper reviews the idea of a 'level playing field' for transport investment and the 'new realism' in transport policy which advocates the need for demand management rhough the direct regulation of street environments and the land use planning system. In addition to environmental, political and social concerns surrounding such trends, macro-economic circumstances have been an important feature of road transport regulation. In such a climate, private finance is seen increasingly as an alternative to public investment. The paper discusses the Private Finance Initiative and the consequences for road provision and demand management. The need for an increased understanding of the subjective constraints on behaviour in a demand management context, where environmentally sustainable modes are likely to be increasingly advocated, and the need to secure investment for these modes are also discussed.},

funding_text 1={June 1994, NHS Trusts ordered to fund hospital building privately. By January 1997, no privately financed scheme had been approved. Contractors have spent flO0 million bidding for 30 PFI schemes. Of these, 2.5 have reached preferred bidder stage and no final contracts have been signed. Contractors disillusioned and refusing to bid for contracts until first deal is signed Lack of co-ordination. Unlike PFI roads and prisons which are ordered by government departments, each PFI hospital is commissioned by a separate NHS trust. Contractor’s bidding costs have rocketed because all the trusts are devising their own tender rules and contract clauses. Inexperienced hospital managers. Until the launch of PFI managers never had to commission their own buildings. Many managers have floundered in their negotiations with contractors and their banks. Over-ambitious trusts. Hospital managers have demanded lavish new hospitals without realising they cannot afford them. Affordability. Even after cutting out hospital managers’ excessived emands, trusts are struggling to afford the schemes. Although the PFI schemes work out cheaper over 30 years than publicly financed hospitals, the charges are higher in the first few years. Risk. Trusts have attempted to pass excessive and ill defined risk to the private sector which has been resisted by contractors and their banks. The financial precariousness of trusts. Banks keen to lend to PFI hospitals are worried that many trusts will not survive the 25. or 30-year lifetime of a PFI contract. Inadequate support from the Department of Health and the Treasury. Guidance notes to help bidders and contractors are sparse and often contradictory.},

abstract={Until the early 90s/corporate finance managers in India were given very little freedom in the choice of key financial policies as the government regulated the pricing of debt and equity instruments and directed the flow of credit. Financial sector reform over the last six years has exposed managers to complex financial choices amidst increased volatility of interest rates and exchange rates, and made them accountable to an increasingly competitive financial marketplace. Nevertheless, the slow pace of financial liberalization so far has given Indian corporates the luxury of learning slowly and adapting gradually. Gradualism has also meant that there is a large unfinished agenda of financial sector reforms. According to Jayanth Varma/Indian companies should now prepare themselves for further changes that lie ahead. The East Asian crisis is a warning for the Indian corporate sector to pursue more prudent and sustainable financial policies. © 1998 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={To remain viable in today's stringent financial climate, British university departments are having to recruit more and more students and look increasingly to less costly alternative forms of delivery. Autonomous learning is seen by many to be the obvious option. Some language departments have responded by introducing autonomous language learning into their curriculum, and there are a number of interesting and innovative approaches that have been developed in a small number of universities. This article sounds a warning that it is neither an easy nor a cheap alternative and that there are important economic, psychological, pedagogical, and practical issues to address if autonomous language learning is to achieve any measure of success.},

Dutch investment funds participating in tropical forest plantations project high expected returns. However, they carry huge financial risks, in particular country risk, currency risk, price risk and credit risk. The environmental and developmental returns appear to be positive but rather small. In addition, the environmental and developmental risks do not appear to be very large, as most plantations are established on former farmland and the quantitative impact of the plantations is still limited.},

abstract={This article focuses on the prospects of the financial systems approach to development finance to ensure sustainable access to financial services for microentrepreneurs. It discusses three prerequisites for the success of this approach: the continued application of financial liberalisation policies; the delivery of financial services on a commercially viable basis by emulating the successes of informal financial intermediaries in solving the problems normally experienced by the formal financial sector when serving microentrepreneurs; and the continued appropriate support from governments and the donor community. It is postulated that these prerequisites will be fulfilled, making the author cautiously optimistic that the financial systems approach to development finance will succeed in securing sustainable access to financial services for microentrepreneurs in the 21st century.},

abstract={This paper assesses the contribution that forums have made in progressing sustainable land use policies and decisions within rural Wales. The examples of Cardigan Bay Forum and Wales Rural Forum are used to show how sustainability has been addressed within their overall agendas. The contemporary debate about sustainable development has provoked a new organizational response with forums visible in many activities and initiatives. The traditional adversarial approach between groups has been replaced by a more sophisticated and complex assemblage of bodies that together create the forum ideal. Consensus, partnership and mutual understanding form the language of this new discourse. However, their presence raises certain key questions as to their role, purpose, representativeness and value in rural resource management debates. These questions have not been considered in the literature, and with the increasing proliferation of forums generally, there is a need to assess whether they are bringing about real and effective change. The two examples reveal clear evidence of forums as agents of change. However there is considerable tension within both forums, within a climate of financial and membership vulnerability, between the need for involving all legitimate interests and the need to achieve meaningful outcomes for individual members. Such tension goes to the heart of who the two forums actually represent and their resulting actions. The way that these tensions have been reconciled lie at the heart of the forum phenomenon.},

abstract={The Bolivian Social Investment Fund (SIF) is a financial institution that promotes sustainable investments in the social sectors, principally in the areas of health, education, and sanitation. This article shows how to use preintervention data collected for evaluating the SIF to improve the targeting of a program, to test the quality of the evaluation design, and to define corrective measures if necessary. It finds that among SIF interventions the benefits in education are distributed relatively equally over the population, while the investments in health and sanitation favor better-off communities. The article contributes to the methods used to evaluate social investment funds and similar programs. It compares two types of evaluation designs to assess social investment fund interventions in the education sector. The authors demonstrate that a simple matched-comparison design introduces a bias in the estimate of the program effect, whereas an experimental design based on random assignment does not. With preintervention data, the analyst can select a quasi or indirect experiment, where the choice of the indirect experiment coincides with the selection of valid instrumental variables. The availability of preintervention data makes it possible to compare the two types of evaluation designs as well as to test the validity of the instruments and to determine the loss of efficiency due to the use of quasi-experimental techniques instead of random treatment assignment.},

abstract={In a climate of diminishing financial resources in service industries such as health care and education, it is not surprising that a focus on measuring and ensuring appropriate outcomes is widespread. Graduate education has the potential to make a significant difference to the professional behaviour of graduates. Postgraduate nursing coursework programs have been developed and offered in such a climate, many now charging full course fees, which no doubt stimulates participants and employers to look for value for money in terms of outcomes. A ten year longitudinal study began in 1992 and was designed to determine the impact of postgraduate coursework nursing education on the careers and the professional and personal development of graduates. This paper reports graduates' perception of their personal and professional growth in terms of professional activities such as writing for publication, research, mentoring, and involvement in professional organisations at the completion of their university course. Respondents indicated the course had contributed to increased professional behaviours in all aspects and to a marked improvement in their clinical confidence. Improved self esteem and increased participation in professional activities reflects changing attitudes towards nursing work that have important implications for improved quality of patient care.},

A question that arises is what part nurses play and what their perceptions on financial advocacy for patients are. A non-experimental descriptive study was done to determine what nurses' perceptions on financial advocacy are and how knowledgeable they are about the costs of disposable dispensary stock. Thirty patient accounts were analysed and questionnaires were completed by a convenience sample of thirty two registered nurses who had permanent appointments in high care or intensive care units. RESULTS: On average nurses control the utilization of 15.8% of each of the prescription accounts. Only 12.5% of respondents had formal education on their responsibility in keeping costs low. The majority (60%) of the 50% of respondents who had previously received information had performed financial advocacy although 94% agreed that they have the responsibility to do so. A mere 9% was achieved on the knowledge of the costs involved in using consumable products from the dispensary.},

abstract={Views regarding the potential contribution of micro-finance programmes to women's empowerment currently fall into four main (not necessarily mutually exclusive) camps: those who stress the positive evidence and are essentially optimistic about the possibility of global development of sustainable micro-finance programmes which empower women; those who recognise limitations to empowerment but see the question as one of programme design and seek to identify models and strategies which can minimise negative impacts and enhance contribution to empowerment; those who recognise limitations to empowerment but see the provision of cost-effective micro-finance programmes as important in themselves as a strategy for poverty alleviation and see empowerment as an issue to be addresseed by other means; those who see the limitations as inherent and the current emphasis on micro-finance programmes as misplaced diversion of resources. Debates are dogged firstly by profound disagreement about what is meant by empowerment and development (and hence the role of micro-finance) manifested in entrenched a priori positions and/or continually shifting definitions and positions. Secondly evidence is incomplete and frequently anecdotal, with detailed study confined to a few organizations where different researchers reach rather different conclusions. Importantly, apart from a few exceptions there is little detailed comparative analysis of the impacts of different models or strategies. The main aims of the paper are to clarify some of the issues raised, identify the gaps in our current understanding and provide frameworks for participatory learning in micro-finance programmes which aim to empower women. The first section of the paper examines the ways in which debates about women's empowerment have been inserted into debates about models of micro-finance provision and the range of anticipated (or implicitly assumed) programme outcomes. The second section examines what we know about actual programme impacts on women and proposes a framework for policy-oriented research on empowerment. The final section looks at potential programme contributions and implications of the findings for gender policy.},

abstract={Introduction: Scrotal ultrasonography remains a safe, non-invasive and rapid method for diagnosing testicular and scrotal disorders. The aim of this audit was to identify patients who unnecessarily underwent ultrasonography, rather than relying on clinical examination to make a diagnosis of their scrotal pathology. Patients and methods: Between 1 January and 30 November 1996, 198 patients (mean age 45.4 years. SD 17) attending our Institution for the investigation of scrotal pathology were identified from the Hospital Information Services System. The notes of each patient were recalled from medical records and a standard proforma was then completed for each patient. Results: Twenty-two (11%) of the patients were emergency admissions and 176 (89%) were seen in the urology out-patient department; 133 patients presented with scrotal swelling, 65 (49%) on the left, 65 (49%) on the right and three (2.3%) bilaterally. Of the scrotal ultrasonograms requested, 41.5% were generated from consultant staff, 16% from higher urological trainees and 43% from urological senior house officers. The clinical diagnosis was of a testis tumour in eight cases (4%), epididymal cysts in 63 (32%). hydrocele in 38 (19%). normal testes in 33 (16%) and varicocele in 20 (10%). The remaining 38 cases (19%) comprised a mixture of postvasectomy pain, sperm granuloma and epididymitis. Ultrasonographically, four testis tumours were identified, there being a correlation between clinical findings and the scan in 175 cases (88%) and a discrepancy in 23 (12%). No testicular tumours were missed clinically and no patient's management was altered by the results from ultrasonography. Conclusion: In our institution, ultrasonography is often performed unnecessarily in patients with benign scrotal swellings and in the current financial climate this has obvious implications for saving costs. © 1997 British Journal of Urology.},

abstract={This article is based on a paper prepared for the Denmark/South Africa/UNDP Workshop on Financial Mechanisms and Sources of Finance for Sustainable Forestry, held in Pretoria, South Africa from 4 to 7 June 1996. It presents perceptions of the main opportunities and constraints to funding forestry development for Asia and the Pacific, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. These perceptions were derived from a series of regional studies carried out by FAO. The Organization believes that, in the current search for innovative ways to increase funding for forestry, beneficiaries ' preferences and perceptions of bottlenecks should not be ignored, as they may offer useful insight for designing better funding priorities and approaches than those currently in place.},

DESIGN Cross-sectional mailed survey. SETTING University of Toronto family medicine program. PARTICIPANTS First- and second-year residents in the academic year 1995 to 1996. A 74.6% response rate (144 of 193 residents) was achieved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Intention to relocate to the United States. Degree of importance of 11 motivational factors in residents' decisions to relocate. RESULTS In this survey, 48% of residents reported they intended to relocate to the United States, but only 17% recalled expecting to relocate before Ontario's introduction of geographic billing restriction legislation. Geographic billing restriction was the motivational factor most residents (86.8%) considered very important in their decision-making process. The two factors potentially predicting US relocation were finance and climate. CONCLUSIONS Many factors influence family medicine residents' intention to relocate to the United States. Geographic billing restriction was the most significant motivational factor, and its introduction has likely precipitated a marked shift in residents' attitudes favouring US relocation.},

States that these are that the criteria for investment selection are different, and the modes of permissible financing may also differ, but there are screening and reporting techniques which are of potential importance to both groups of investors. First addresses ethical fund management issues, which should shed some light on the dilemmas facing Islamic investors. Goes on to consider criteria for haram and halal investment, as well as the implications of company capital gearing or leverage for riba. Covers investment specific issues, including the treatment of capital gains in Islam and the evaluation of the conduct of market participants. Finally, surveys emerging markets in the Islamic world, as these are of obvious interest to Muslim investors wishing to broaden their portfolios. © Copyright - 1997 MCB UP Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, many South East Asian nations have shown strong economic growth coupled with success in attracting considerable direct foreign investment. In order to sustain the current and projected growth levels, many countries in South East Asia will need to focus on major investments for infrastructure development, especially in their power generation and distribution sectors. As highlighted by the current financial crises being experienced in several South East Asian nations, the future growth of this region will require much stronger support from the international financial institutions, which in turn will lead this region toward a greatly increased level of privatization. The establishment of contestable energy markets is a particularly good example of the type of developments required in these nations. In order to create a healthy climate for the massive financial investment needed for a truly liberalized energy market, a number of difficult political and social issues common to many of these rapidly developing economies must be resolved. © 1997 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={James Ryan is operations manager for Latin America for a transnational corporation in the textile industry. Mr. Ryan has been asked to recommend a location for a new company plant in Central America. The two alternatives presented in the case are Guatemala and Costa Rica. At the beginning of the case, Mr. Ryan refers to a series of key criteria, including labor costs, political stability, infrastructure, labor relations, and the parent company's degree of investment diversification. In addition, the case describes the political, economic, social, and demographic characteristics of Guatemala and Costa Rica. It also compares the two countries' export incentive packages, including free trade zones and access to international markets. The case also includes information about the size and operational requirements of the new facilities the company wishes to develop. Thus, it is possible to match what each country has to offer with what the company requires. The case study provides sufficient information to evaluate the relative costs of operating in Guatemala versus Costa Rica. It also furnishes enough data to compare items that are difficult to quantify, such as public utility efficiency, business climate, political, financial, and social stability, and other relevant factors. The principal aim of the case is to develop the key elements that must be considered in making international location decisions for new manufacturing installations of transnational firms. In this case, profitability considerations must be viewed in the context of each country's available resources and degree oj country risk. The case also may be used to conduct an economic analysis, comparing the employment benefits that a transnational corporation can bring to a country, and what incentives the country can offer the corporation. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract={This article surveys the empirical record of grain marketing and pricing policy in Eastern and Southern Africa over 1930-95. The paper addresses five key issues with major implications for food policy throughout Africa: (a) why the anticipated supply response to market liberalization has not yet occurred; (b) why the common assumption of state taxation of farmers to support a cheap food policy does not apply in most of the countries in the region; (c) why the temporary successes of the state-led approach to stimulating smallholder grain production were unsustainable; (d) why the elimination of government food subsidies associated with market reform has not adversely affected consumers; and (e) why the fiscal cost of the marketing systems at least initially worsened rather than improved after the reforms were implemented in most countries. The key future challenges for marketing policy are how to develop coordinated and financially sustainable input, finance and commodity marketing systems for raising productivity growth in smallholder agriculture while overcoming inherited agricultural dualism, and how to mitigate the effects of food price instability in a cost-effective manner. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract={The impact of carbon sequestration on the financial profitability of four tree plantation cases in Finland and the Philippines were examined. On the basis of stem wood growth; the accumulation of carbon in forest biomass, the formation and decomposition of litter, and the carbon flows in wood-based products were assessed for each reforestation case representing boreal (Finland) and moist tropical conditions (the Philippines). Using different unit values for carbon sequestration the profitability of reforestation was estimated for a fixed 100 year period on a per hectare basis. The financial profitability of reforestation increased notably when the sequestered carbon had high positive values. For example, when the value of carbon sequestration was set to be Twenty-five United States Dollars per megagram of carbon (25 USD/Mg C), the internal rate of return (IRR) of a reforestation investment with spruce (Picea abies) in Finland increased from 3.2 % to 4.1 %. Equally, the IRR of reforestation with mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, King) in the Philippines increased from 12.8 % to 15.5 %. The present value of carbon sequestration ranged from 39-48 % and from 77-101 % of the present value of the reforestation costs in Finland and the Philippines, respectively, when a 25 USD/Mg C shadow price and a 5 % discount rate were applied. Sequestration of one Mg of carbon in reforestation in Finland and the Philippines was estimated to cost from 10.5-20.0 and from 4.0-13.6 USD, respectively.},

abstract={This article discusses the issue of priorities in development in urban centers of developing countries. Urbanization is advancing rapidly in the developing world. There are needs for adequate infrastructure, environmental protection, and fiscal reform. Development can result in a reduction in poverty, if properly conducted. By the turn of the century, 8 of the world's 10 megacities will be located in developing countries. There are already the megacities of Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Bombay, Calcutta, and Shanghai. By 2015 there will be 27 megacities, and urban population in developing countries will amount to over 4 billion. By 2020, 50% of total population in developing countries and 80% of total population in Latin America will be urban, of which 25% will live in poverty. Economic progress is at risk if cities cannot develop effective roads and transportation systems, public transportation, communications, sanitation services, and adequate shelters. The City Summit was held in June 1996 in Istanbul. The World Bank announced priorities for funding of urban health initiatives for reducing lead and particulate emissions, for providing sanitation and clean water to slum areas, and for securing sustainable, business-like city finances. The World Bank, the City Summit's Global Plan of Action, and Parliamentarians for Global Action support the reduction of lead emissions from gasoline and air. Cost-effective approaches include refitting public transportation vehicles with cleaner-burning engines or engines relying on natural gas, reducing emissions from industrial and power plants, and shifting domestic fuel sources from coal to natural gas. The World Bank in Slovenia and Beijing is financially supporting this household conversion. Reductions in soot and dust levels reduce public health costs, lost work time due to illness, and mortality. The cost to the poor for basic services is too high. Decentralization, community involvement, and cost sharing are viable options.},

abstract={The 'front-line' in the war against deforestation is decision-making by individual landowners and other stewards about land-use allocation which, according to economic theory, involves the unbiased comparison of returns from competing options. In this study discounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate the potential returns from three land-use options available to landowners in Costa Rica: sustainable forest management, cattle ranching, and crop production. A growth-and-yield projection model was used to predict the periodic timber yields from a sample of forests in the three most important timber producing regions: the south, north, and Atlantic zones. Information on product yields and costs for the agricultural alternatives was obtained from interviews with farmers. Price data for both timber and agricultural products including historic rates of change were taken from a recent study investigating price trends. The findings suggest that landowners are not basing their land-use decisions on economic grounds alone, and that alternative explanations for their behavior must be sought. Two possible reasons are that landowners may be averse to the periodic nature of the cash flows associated with forest management and/or they may lack basic information on the potential returns and technical requirements for the forestry alternative. Suggestions for government policies needed to promote retention of the remaining natural tropical rainforests are offered.},

abstract={As intraspinal opioid infusions are being offered to an increasing number of patients with chronic noncancer pain, technical considerations and complications have become important. For these technical considerations, there are points that are unclear and controversial and others that appear to be 'minor' but, if missed, can lead to disastrous pump complications. Among the controversial areas are type of testing for a spinal infusion, method for needle placement in the spine, and type of pump. For the apparently minor considerations, important areas are attention to the method of puncture of the paraspinal fascia, anchoring of catheter, pump placement, and initial filling of the pump. As experience with these infusions is accumulated, and as the financial climate in medicine changes, the approaches to these techniques appear to be changing toward a general consensus. Recent scientific advances, both in newer analgesic substances and in innovative methods for intraspinal delivery of these substances, also are affecting these approaches.},

The papers in this collection represent only a small fraction of the more than 45 papers presented by scholars, practitioners and donor agencies at the Conference. They have been selected in an effort to give a sense of the richness and variety of the conference deliberations - and as expressing some of the key themes and concerns which emerged. In this introduction - as at the conference - the importance of building sustainable financial systems for poor men and women is emphasized. The main themes point to recognizing the heterogeneity of the poor and its implications for program and institutional design, evaluating the limitations imposed by the policy and regulatory environment, and solving the challenges posed by institution building.},

abstract={In this paper I argue that the capitalist state and industry have restructured both the financial and moral climate to ensure that radical change does not influence the position of ruling elites. Community development initiatives, in a similar fashion to education, become a means of managing the population rather than the means of initiating real change. The concept of economic regeneration is a social construct which masks unemployment, poverty and a low wage economy. In this paper I examine, briefly, a small locality set against more broad patterns of change. I attempt to illustrate how the local patterns interact in a dialectical fashion with the national and supernational patterns. © 1995 Oxford University Press.},

abstract={The gerontology certificate remains the most widely awarded credential resulting from the continuing growth of gerontology education structures in American colleges and universities. The proliferation of multidisciplinary education in gerontology raises concerns about curriculum quality, vitality, and development; employment and career advancements in aging agencies; and the centrality of gerontology education to institutional missions in a climate of diminishing financial resources and refocusing of academic priorities. In a reassessment study, we obtained data from graduates (N = 92) of the Certificate of Graduate Study in Gerontology Program at the University of South Carolina 6 years after a follow-up survey of graduates (N = 40) in 1987. The Standardized Survey Instrument for Graduates of Gerontology Programs, developed by the Association for Gerontology in Higher Education (AGHE; 1989), was used to elicit demographic information; educational histories; information on gerontology employment activities, sources of assistance in gaining employment, and salary levels; and views regarding the adequacy of gerontology education as preparation for work in aging agencies. Analysis of the survey data supports the goals and interdisciplinary focus of the educational program, reveals a rich diversity of graduates’ educational and career attainments, and provides a strong indication that AGHE graduate certificate curriculum standards have helped strengthen the program’s quality. Additional data indicate several areas requiring curriculum development to support the career advancement of graduates in management and planning positions in aging and health care organizations. © 1995 Taylor and Francis.},

abstract={As a candidate for a position, your job is to identify the expectations of physicians, why previous administrators have failed to meet these expectations and the limits within which a new administrator can operate. Most groups that approach experienced administrators with the prospect of future employment have already lost their administrator, either through a forced termination or the administrator's voluntary move. Administrators who do not adequately evaluate the opportunity usually receive their walking papers in a relatively short time, or depart on their own with a blustery "let-me-out-of-here" attitude. The key to success is knowledge. You must ferret out the fine points, understand the political climate the group's past financial performance, determine if there is a strategic plan and if it is taken seriously, and most of all, push to gain an understanding of what the key objectives are for the administrator in the first year. Then, you must determine the board's willingness to extend authority. Remember, the next position you accept will profoundly influence every corner of your life: finances, career, lifestyle, marriage and family.},

abstract={The viability of rural logging communities in the Northwest is threatened. Even with sustainable forest management, financial and technological changes are decreasing the employment opportunities in rural communities. The contribution of the logging industry to local economies has been decreasing due to timber competition from other regions, technological change, and the spotted owl controversy. This study reports on the attitudes of people involved in the economic development of the rural Northwest who attended regional economic development conferences held in 1991 and 1992. The participants at each conference rated the economic situation of the region as poor, and primarily blamed federal regulations for their current economic problems. They recognized the need to develop a diversified rural economy and believed the region's greatest economic assets were its environmental quality and quality of life. Attendance at the first regional economic development conference resulted in short-term improvement in attitudes about the future of the rural areas. © 1995, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In the framework of the IFPRI/University of Hohenheim Project "Credit for the Rural Poor in Sub-Saharan Africa', a detailed micro-economic survey has been conducted from October 1991 to October 1992 in three Cameroonian provinces (Adamawa, North West and West). The empirical results support the hypothesis that food security relates to financial market access and income improvements. Access to sustainable financial market services improves incomes, and in turn, income has a positive and significant impact on rural households, food security. Financial market services can improve food security in providing rural production and consumption credit? -from Author},

abstract={The Eastern Cape Subtropical Thicket (ECST) froms the transition between forest, semiarid karroid shrublands, and grassland in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Undegraded ECST forms an impenetrable, spiny thicket up to 3 m high consisting of a wealth of growth forms, including evergreen plants, succulent and deciduous shrubs, lianas, grasses, and geophytes. The thicket dynamics are not well understood, but elephants may have been important browsers and patch disturbance agents. These semiarid thickets have been subjected to intensive grazing by domestic ungulates, which have largely replaced indigenous herbivores over the last 2 centuries. Overgrazing has extensively degraded vegetation, resulting in the loss of phytomass and plant species and the replacement of perennials by annuals. Coupled with these changes are alterations of soil structure and secondary productivity. This rangeland degradation has largely been attributed to pastoralism with domestic herbivores. The impact of indigenous herbivores differs in scale, intensity, and nature from that of domestic ungulates. Further degradation of the ECST may be limited by alternative management strategies, including the use of wildlife for meat production and ecotourism. Producing meat from wildlife earns less income than from domestic herbivores but is ecologically sustainable. The financial benefits of game use can be improved by developing expertise, technology, and marketing. Ecotourism is not well developed in the Eastern Cape although the Addo Elephant National Park is a financial success and provides considerable employment benefits within an ecologically sustainable system. The density of black rhinoceros and elephant in these thickets is among the highest in Africa, with high population growth and the lowest poaching risk. The financial and ecological viability of ecotourism and the conservation status of these two species warrant expanding ecotourism in the Eastern Cape, thereby reducing the probability of further degradation of ECST. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract={The 8th GLOBE International General Assembly held in Washington, D.C., on March 2, 1994 discussed three main issues: 1) the relationship between trade and the environment; 2) the responsibility of international financial institutions to promote sustainable development; and 3) the export of hazardous waste. In addition, the population issue was considered in the context of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo September 5-13, 1994. Despite a variety of regional and national differences in opinion, intense discussions led to the unanimous adoption of an action program in each of the issue areas. The Action Agenda on Population is addresses the following four areas: 1) activities for GLOBE to undertake before the Cairo Conference; 2) comments and proposals for the Cairo document; 3) recommendations for the promotion of international cooperation; and 4) recommendations for the prevention of and preparation for sudden and large-scale population movements. The Cairo document should spend more time addressing North-South issues. The document seems to dwell disproportionately on how to help the South solve their problems, and not enough on the role the North must play in reforming their own consumption and production patterns, or working with the South. This theme must emerge more clearly. GLOBE actions and proposals centered on the issues of interrelationship between population, sustained economic growth and sustainable development; reproductive rights, reproductive health and family planning; population distribution, urbanization, and internal migration; and international migration. Japan and the United States agreed to provide a total of $12 billion over the period of 1994-2000 to assist developing countries in population problems and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. GLOBE members will request allocation of some of these resources to improving the literacy, education, reproductive health, and status of women.},

abstract={Since the first national park was created at Yellowstone in the USA in 1872, over 8500 protected areas have been established worldwide. Virtually all countries have seen the wisdom of protecting areas of outstanding importance to society, and such sites now cover over 5% of Earth's land surface. However, many of these protected areas exist only on paper, not on the ground. Most are suffering from a combination of threats, including pollution, over-exploitation, encroachment, poaching, and many others. In a period of growing demands on resources and shrinking government budgets, new approaches are required to ensure that protected areas can continue to make their contributions to society. First and foremost, protected areas must be designed and managed in order to provide tangible and intangible benefits to society. This will involve integrating protected areas into larger planning and management frameworks, linking protected areas to biodiversity and climate change, promoting greater financial support for protected areas, and expanding international cooperation in the finance, development and management of protected areas. © 1994 Chapman & Hall.},

abstract={Organisations face increasing demands to measure their environmental performance. This is necessary in order to achieve sustainable development to reassure financial stakeholders that their investments are not at risk, to satisfy the demands of regulators and other non‐financial stakeholders and to provide information for customers and employees. Measures can be grouped into ten generic categories ‐ impact, risk, emissions /waste, input, resource, efficiency, customer, financial, normalised and aggregate. At least six different approaches to using measures can be identified ‐ production, auditing, ecological, accounting, economic and quality. Although there has been some limited cross‐fertilisation, in most cases they have developed in isolation from each other and have had different drivers, measurement focii and metrics. In order to achieve the comparison, integration and business relevance which is routine in financial performance measurement, a seventh approach ‐ that of strategic environment‐related performance measurement ‐ is both needed and beginning to develop. The long term challenge is to stretch measurement systems to include the sustainability of business activities (through impact measures) and the competitive advantage they are creating (through customer and financial measures). A ‘balanced scorecard’ of measures is essential too, as is clear identification of the customers of the measures. The comparison which is facilitated by standardised measurement is also a powerful spur to continuous improvement of environmental performance. Copyright © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract={Sustainable growth models are financial planning tools which weigh financial objectives with operational performance to determine the optimum level of growth for a firm. The gas utility industry is unlike many other industries in that its growth has been dependent on its ability to raise substantial capital in the equity markets. This paper examines the actual and sustainable growth of the US gas utility industry from 1970 to 1990. Each sector of the industry - distribution, transmission, integrated and combination - has different financial objectives and operational performance which has resulted in different rates of growth in revenues. The inefficiency of the pricing system established by the regulation of these sectors was apparent in the declining profit margins in the 1970s and rising asset utilization ratios in the 1980s, both of which adversely affected the sustainable growth rates. Substantial growth potential exists in this industry through future stock issues, operational improvements and changes in financial objectives. Sustainable growth models are shown to be an effective financial planning tool, as well as a tool for directing policies to stimulate growth in this industry. © 1994.},

abstract={Effectively addressing the existing and continuously growing enormous demands and needs for shelter depends critically on the availability of long-term housing finance on a fairly large and sustainable scale. Policy approaches to realise this situation are still issues of continuing debate in professional circles. The central issues of focus are sustainable availability, affordability and accessibility of housing finance to households. Evidence currently indicates that a dominant proportion of housing in developing countries is accounted for by informal non-institutional sources but it has been increasingly strongly argued that development of a formal institutional housing finance system is indispensable for effectively addressing the quantitative and qualitative housing inadequacy problem. One of the most strongly canvassed strategies is for housing finance to be integrated into the larger national financial system and for its operation to be based on pure market pricing mechanisms, free of government interference. This paper attempts to identify, review and synthesise from available experiences and literature, the issues involved in this debate, having regard to the general state of institutional development and the prevailing macroeconomic (including financial) climate in most developing countries. Inferences from the review indicate that, all things considered, an informal housing financing system will remain a viable option and that, in the circumstances of developing countries, the long-term development of sustainable institutional housing finance systems requires continued discrete and prudent roles for government to establish and to enforce an effective system of rules, regulations, safeguards and supervisory functions to monitor and to prevent abuses. Some degree of support (subsidy) and incentives, albeit indirect, may even be necessary and advisable. While integration of housing finance into the national financial system and market sourcing and pricing may be the desired goals, these will be very much in the long term. © 1994, Sage Publications.

abstract={In the current climate of scarce financial resources health care managers have had to question the financial viability of a 36-hour stay in an ICU for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The management of this group of patients has had to be reexamined. The solution to this problem appears to lie in the utilisation of a designated recovery area for the management of this group of patients. This paper is an audit of the first 100 cardiac patients who recovered in such a designated recovery unit. The audit examines types of operations performed, average length of time patients required artificial ventilation, blood loss in the first 4h, average length of stay in hospital, and postoperative complications. Possible methods of improving the utilisation of a recovery area in the management of postoperative cardiac patients are discussed. The conclusion is that utilisation of a designated recovery area for the immediate postoperative management of cardiac surgical patients is a financially viable alternative to an intensive care environment. More importantly, high quality service and care is maintained without increasing the utilisation of resources. © 1994.},

Questions have been raised regarding the impact of these mergers on market competition, exploration activity, oil investments, and the replacement of oil reserves. This article investigates the reasons for the mergers and acquisitions, their merits and demerits, and the various methods that are used to finance them. Furthermore, it examines the measures adopted by the oil companies in defense of takeover attempts. These measures have become vital to corporate strategy. During the past few years there has been a significant increase in mergers and acquisitions in the petroleum industry. Several explanations have been put forth to explain the heightened merger activity. According to North, the financial climate in the U.S., in the early 1980s, was highly favorable to the major oil companies. Banks were eager to lend to the oil.},

abstract={This article describes remedial options for the treatment of heavy metal and petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. Treatment of these soils with traditional methods often requires a combination of techniques, resulting in treatment costs that are unacceptable in today's financial climate. A detailed review of relevant remedial technologies is presented, as well as treatability studies for hybrid immobilization, petroleum hydrocarbon reduction, extraction, and soil washing technologies. Our studies and review demonstrate that hybrid immobilization may be suitable for sites where only soluble chemical levels exceed federal or state guidelines; soil washing may provide a viable alternative for sites with appropriate soil characteristics; petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation can potentially reduce soluble lead levels; and extraction processes, though promising, still require some development. Descriptions of the chemical and physical properties of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and residual levels of these chemicals in soil following treatment are also given.

abstract={Present-value models are currently available for both single cash flows and continuous uniform cash flows under uncertain timing. Recent work by the authors has concentrated mainly on establishing theoretical results concerning the conditions under which unimodality will be introduced into the present-value distribution, particularly under exponential timing. Apart from the conventional (0) unimodality, there are two other forms of unimodality available which refer more to the nature of the unimodal behaviour rather than its location. When the timing mechanism operating for a continuous uniform cash flow is modelled by a geometrically distributed sum of exponential inter-assessment times, this paper establishes that the present-value distribution adopts a form of unimodality which is conceptually and structurally distinct from that form of unimodality adopted within the single cash flow analogue. Each present-value distribution will therefore become (0) unimodal under different prevailing economic conditions. One financial implication of these results is that it should be possible to develop coherent funding strategies for selecting a single cash flow option or a continuous uniform cash flow option having due regard to the current financial climate. © 1993.},

Comparisons between groups at posttest on parental measures of family functioning showed that changes reported by the minimal-contact control group were significantly greater than those of the time-unlimited group. When assessments from pretest to 4-year follow-up were compared, all groups improved significantly on therapist measures of goal attainment, but only the minimal-contact control group reported significant improvements on severity of target problems and measures of family functioning.

The GEF's role under the conventions was a continuing point of controversy during their negotiation. A preliminary resolution was reached only a few weeks before the treaties were opened for signature at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. It is a compromise that promises to alter significantly the institutional character of the GEF and circumscribes its role under the conventions. The GEF is entrusted with financial transfers under both conventions, but only on an interim basis. The interim role was agreed to in exchange for a package of reforms to its structure and governance that will move it away from the World Bank and closer to the UN system and institutions, in particular the conferences of parties of the two conventions. The conventions have taken control of policy, program priorities, and eligibility criteria for financial transfers for climate change and biodiversity prerogatives that otherwise would have rested with the GEF. -Author},

abstract={It is helpful to examine the overall problem of indebtedness in order to devise solutions that would encourage developing countries to consider the environment while at the same time lightening their burden of external indebtedness. There are four types of financial transfer mechanisms: official bilateral aid, multilateral resources, private funding and debt cancellation. The objective proposed to the OECD countries by the UN is far from having been achieved. Multilateral resources came primarily from the World Bank; here again, contributions are voluntary, and are made by only a small number of countries. Funding from private sources is modest. Cancellation of debt is a promising mechanism, but one that is difficult to implement. The interdependence between economic growth and the environment accentuates the consequences of indebtedness on sustainable development. The concept of converting bank debt into an environmental protection program, first put forward in 1983, has aroused a great deal of interest from multilateral organizations. The number and size of transactions are still very modest primarily due to legal and technical barriers. While conversions require the creation of an appropriate macroeconomic framework, the problem is not strictly financial. Sustainable projects are still too few in number, and funding can sometimes conflict with durability requirements. -from English summary},

Earlier studies had inticated leakage of reducing gases, CO and H2 into the system resulting in reduction of dichromate to trivalent chromium and precipitation of chromate into the ammoniacal stream. Failed samles from a number of components of heat exchangers, rectificator and steam rebolier were investigated by visual, microstructural, microhardness and stereomicroscopic examinations. Thinning of the material and perforations were observed in addition to the surfaces affected by erosion corrosion. The cause of the failure has been attributed to erosion corrosion by the precipitated chromate and/or other suspended impurities in the high velocity ammoniacal streams, and steps to be taken to minimize the corrosion damage have been suggested.},

abstract={The "green revolution" was desirable because of increased crop yields, but 25 years later after the results of land degradation, groundwater contamination, and environmentally harmful practices were revealed, there is a return to sustainable agriculture. The aim is to minimize agriculture's harmful effects on the environment and to maintain water ad soil resources. Present and future food production depends on suitable land, water, climate, and finances. Unfortunately, the timing is wrong. Population growth is putting pressure on farmers to increase yields. The current conditions are the 11% of the earth's vegetative land surface has diminished productivity due to human activity. There is loss of biodiversity and genetic material. CAttle grazing is inefficient and adds to desertification; animal waste contributes to pollution. Pesticides and fertilizers are the largest US water pollutants. Sustainable agriculture means new tilling methods, reducing pesticide use, and crop rotation. The National Research Council in 1989 reported on alternative agriculture: 1) making the most of natural biological processes; 2) reducing or eliminating pesticides and other chemicals; 3) conserving soil, water, and energy; and 4) matching crops with land to ensure sustainable production levels. Reeducation is needed. Operation SAVE (Sustainable Agriculture that's Voluntary and Economical) produces an annual directory and guide for farmers adopting new methods. Land trusts and conservation easements are being established to preserve farmland. Reclamation of degraded land is being promoted by distribution of tree seedlings to developing countries. Community supported agriculture groups share in the cost of raising crops and receive organic, fresh produce. There are fears about economic feasibility. Conventional farmers argue for pesticide use to increase yields, but a Cornell University study refutes this for organically grown corn. High technology research is not likely to yield a new variety of seed before 2000. Research is needed for poor subsistence farmers. Food distribution is not a problem if everyone is vegetarian. Global warming could also precipitously change climate and affect crops. Population growth will play a significant role in determining the outcome of the world's struggle to feed people and protect the planet.},

abstract={Economic instruments, such as effluent fees and tradable discharge permits (TDP), have often been suggested by economists as efficient or cost-effective means to control pollution. In recent years such instruments have received increasing attention due to their growing political acceptability. Still, their use in practice has been tentative. The interest in possible application of such instruments has led to a set of studies regarding their practical potential. These studies indicate that economic instruments require substantial government involvement, entailing high administration cost; require restrictions so as to prevent significant deterioration in receptor areas; and have ambivalent effects on innovation adoption. Consequently, the efficiency gains from such instruments may be smaller than potential gains identified in earlier studies. In addition, the distributional impacts of such instruments and their possible adverse effect on market contestability reduce their attractiveness in some cases. These findings raise the question: what is the desired role of economic instruments in addressing environmental concerns? In recent years the demand for environmental services has increased dramatically. Current legislation and studies indicate that desired environmental expenditures are likely to increase. At the same time environmental programs face increasing competition from other programs for a declining pool of general revenues. One outcome of these processes has been the search for alternative sources of funds for environmental programs. Furthermore, as the competition for general revenue funds increases, the allocation of such funds for environmental programs becomes less predictable. This may endanger many long-term environmental programs that require stable funding. This article suggests that economic instruments may prove one source of dedicated funds for many environmental goals. Consequently, studies of environmental-program financing as well as studies of economic instruments may well explore the possible role of economic instruments as financing tools. Some examples of the potential of such tools for estuary cleanup programs are discussed. © 1992 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract={This article reiterates the case for tradeable permits as a global policy option for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and considers the detailed design of a global tradeable-permit regime, emphasising the importance of the initial assignment of property rights, and arguing that the relevant property rights in this case are the rights of every member of the world community to share in a sustainable global atmosphere and climate. The allocation of permits should therefore be done on a per capita basis across the world community, with the result that rents generated by the process of reducing carbon emissions would accrue to non-polluters, most of whom live in the ‘South’. The international transfers of income and wealth implied by the proposed scheme are large but feasible. There is therefore a real prospect that an international convention on carbon dioxide emissions could end the debt crisis and finance sustainable development in the South. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={Concern for the natural environment has not occupied a prominent role in accounting scholarship and practice. This paper attempts to redress this omission by investigating the implications for accounting of placing the environment at the centre of the analysis. The paper introduces the principles of this "deep green" position and explores how accounting might articulate them. Whilst there may be no place for what we currently consider to be conventional financial accounting in any "green utopia" the paper does not attempt to operationalise, within a non-green world, certain of the principles of the green position. Emphasis is placed on an accounting's potential for contribution to accountability and transparency in participative democracy, the potential for non-financial accounts of the biosphere and, perhaps most contentiously, the use of current accounting techniques for the operationalisation of an accounting for sustainability. © 1992.},

abstract={A process may be seen as that which has purpose, organization and structure, facilitating an act of moving forward Thus, a process reflects Bruner's view of education as facilitating cognitive growth and as a way in which individuals explore and gain mastery over a complex world A process approach is not without its problems, namely in that some nursing skills require a precise, predetermined outcome best achieved by the use of behavioural objectives A curriculum promoting growth and continued learning calls for increased funding, which may cause problems in today's financial climate Exploration of concepts calls for careful planning of practical experience and may be difficult where supernumerary status is not fully implemented However, a process approach may reduce the theory practice gap and lead to a reflective and proactive practitioner On‐going education of clinical staff is required and increased communication between educational and clinical staff This approach may lead to a more holistic view of nursing education and achievement measured in not only quantitative but also qualitative terms Solving the problems that a process approach may present may cause nursing education to be enhanced Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract={Conventional approaches to the provision of learning and training opportunities often leave much to be desired in terms of their suitability, their relevance and their cost-effectiveness. Of course, in the current financial climate, educational establishments are also being called upon to achieve much higher productivity with minimal increase in resources. In order to meet the increasing demands that are being placed upon conventional training and learning resources, many organizations are actively searching for new approaches to instruction. Because of the attractive facilities that they offer, computer-assisted learning (cal) and computer-based training (cbt) have now become important techniques for both knowledge dissemination and skill acquisition. Five important attributes of these approaches to pedagogy have contributed to their success: efficiency, effectiveness, adaptability, automated monitoring and the high degree of student motivation that can be achieved. For the reasons outlined above, many organizations are now setting up "institutional" cal or cbt centres. Their function is to provide courseware development services on a cross-organizational basis. This paper discusses some architectural blueprints for the creation of a successful courseware development centre. In this paper, we cover such topics as courseware engineering principles, authoring tools, media selection, workstation design, production strategies and the marketing of courseware products. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.},

The federal government made the building available to the City which then contracted with a state university medical center to be the provider of services. This partnering has allowed the Chicago Department of Health to offer services in a previously underserved area. The University has gained an opportunity for community-based primary care teaching, as well as community relations. Patients have increased access to a wide variety of specialty and inpatient care. If public health providers are to be successful in this financial climate, they must look to new partners and new ways of delivering services to increase availability of services at a time when they are greatly needed.},

abstract={A survey of all 50 U.S. states conducted in 1989 showed that 1,300-1,650 requests for cancer cluster investigations were received by state health departments. Most states responded with a three-stage process aimed at prioritizing clusters at each stage. Those situations deemed most serious were passed on to the next stage of evaluation. Thirty-eight of the 50 states said that communicating risk information to informants was a productive outcome, and 26 states sent materials to informants explaining the causes of cancer, clusters, how clusters are investigated, and other health education materials. Many states requested detailed information about reported clusters from informants. States with a major commitment to protecting public health and environment were more likely to provide information than states with weaker programs. Some officials discouraged people from pursuing their requests by trying to convince informants that a problem did not exist and by overwhelming them with questions and information. We recommend that health departments train their respondents in risk communications and establish an organizational climate that provides financial resources and institutional support appropriate to the complex task of communicating risk information to a public alarmed about a cancer cluster. © 1991 Human Sciences Press, Inc.},

However, a longer term view examines the reasons why primary education is, potentially, a very fertile environment for the effective use of IT in education. The stumbling blocks to progress are shortages of resources; hardware, software, technical support and INSET. Suggestions are offered to overcome these, particularly the final two, in the current climate of financial constraint. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={In the literature of development finance, both the structuralist's "two-gap' approach of Chenery and Strout and the financialist's "liberalisation' approach of McKinnon and Shaw represent the two polar theories for academic research and policy recommendations. Harris has attempted to set up a simple model incorporating the two approaches and tested it with the experiences of five Asian economies. This paper first employed Harris' model, and empirically extended the analysis to include other Asian economies, giving particular attention to the financial impacts on growth. Secondly, an attempt is made to incorporate the structure of financial institutions as an instrument of analysis. A general conclusion is that economies with lesser government controlled financial institutions tend to face a more favourable climate for financial development. -Authors},

The main objectives of Bank lending for SMEs are: 1) to strengthen the financial and technical institutions that serve SMEs, 2) to create jobs at a relatively low cost per unit of capital invested, and 3) to correct imperfections in financial markets that constrain access to credit by small borrowers. -from Author},

Output indicators serve to show how practical, how cost-effective, and how sustainable the intervention is in relation to the existing local problems and the institutional capacity to deal with them. Indicators are also proposed for the evaluation of staff and their activities in management, research, planning, and training. -Author},

In depressed or severely distorted economies, however, market-clearing real financial rates may be non-positive. In such circumstances, attempts to force financial rates above market-clearing levels may impede economic recovery and contribute to industrial and financial-system decapitalization. Moreover, policy-makers may effectively be forced to allow inflation to finance payment of excessively high rates. Where financial rates must be administered, policy-makers should aim to equilibrate financial supply and demand, with a view to maintaining financial-system profitability and safety. Policy-makers should regard sustainable positive real financial rates as indicators of a soundly functioning economy, hence as something to achieve, not to force. © 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract={In a climate of financial viability in early 1986, productivity measurement and analysis were implemented as major components of the quality assurance program at University Medical Center at the Arizona Health Sciences Center. The purpose was basically to balance the benefits of conducting an integrated quality assurance program with the operational costs. A fully integrated quality assurance program was implemented at University Medical Center during June, 1985. Comprehensive, 100 percent chart screening is conducted utilizing occurrence screening criteria and criteria for all required JCAH clinical monitors. The quality assurance program is based on the Medical Management Analysis (MMA) system established by Joyce W. Craddick, M.D. Since the immediate plan of the hospital administration's financial sector was to develop units of service for nonrevenue-producing cost centers, the QA director was obligated to develop standards that would demonstrate effective management of the QA department's resources and would project revenue requirements for program development. The QA director elected to conduct a productivity study which resulted in the establishment of performance standards that are currently utilized in budget development to determine staffing needs; to appraise employee performance; and to perform trend analysis.},

Often operating at low reliability, in severe financial difficulty due to inadequate tariffs, and under pressure to expand the network to rural areas at the same time that they are under pressure to reduce capital outlays because of demands to reduce public‐sector spending and concerns over the ability to service foreign debt. Traditional approaches to electric utility planning have become inadequate in this new financial climate. In this paper we explore the institutional, economic, manpower and financial dimensions of the present crisis, and examine their implications for national governments, donor agencies and international financial institutions. We emphasize the need for a more balanced approach to planning models, for improved procedures to deal with uncertainties and for a more imaginative approach to non‐traditional solutions. 1987 United Nations},

abstract={The study reported here comprises the largest and most comprehensive British survey of minor psychiatric morbidity and its correlates in the community, and is the first comprehensive, individual-level investigation of the effect of such morbidity on passage through the first of Goldberg & Huxley's five filters along the 'pathway to psychiatric care'. The findings broadly confirmed those of previous aggregatelevel studies with regard to the influence of minor psychiatric morbidity on the first filter. They also demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between 'consulting for self' and 'consulting on behalf of others' in future studies of the first filter, particularly when the effect of sex is to be examined. Furthermore, the present analyses comprise the first large-scale British study to investigate the joint effects of predisposing and illness-level variables on health service use. In general, they can be said to confirm the results of the large-scale American studies based on the model of Ronald Andersen and his colleagues, in that illness variables - including minor psychiatric morbidity - accounted for the major proportion of the total effect. Unlike these studies, however, interactions between illness-level and predisposing variables were examined. The most important to emerge was that sex, socioeconomic group and minor psychiatric morbidity interacted in an effect on general practitioner consultation, an illness-level/predisposing variable interaction that did not occur with any other measure of morbidity, and one which would clearly repay further study. Apart from these specific findings, the results of these analyses demonstrate the value of secondary analysis of previously-collected survey data. A major commitment of research resources would clearly have been required if the issues addressed here had been researched de nove. In the current climate of tightening financial stringency, the possibility of conducting large-scale health surveys becomes increasingly remote. Thus, the availability of data for, and the appropriateness of, secondary analysis should increasingly be considered.},

abstract={As part of a wider research project, a survey was conducted of all UK physiotherapy schools to outline the current patterns of provision of closed circuit television (CCTV) and how it is being used by staff and students. Analysis of the results shows that, despite the difficult financial climate, CCTV is becoming increasingly available as an education resource, and more teachers are involving themselves in operating the equipment and making their own programmes. Staff seem more inclined to use the medium for teaching than students are to use it for private study. Two particular areas are highlighted and discussed: physiotherapyrelated, staff-produced programmes and CCTV research. A pooling of permanent teaching/ learning video programmes is suggested, controlled by a central agency, for intra- and interprofessional exchange at nominal charge.

abstract={As part of a wider research project, a survey was conducted of all U.K. physiotherapy schools to outline the current patterns of provision of CCTV and how it is being used both by staff and students. Analysis of the results shows that, despite the stringent financial climate, CCTV is increasingly more available as an education resource and more teachers are involving themselves in operating the equipment and in making their own programmes. Staff seem more inclined to use the medium for teaching than students are to use it for learning during private study. Two particular areas are highlighted and discussed. These are physiotherapy-related, staff-produced programmes and CCTV research. A pooling of permanent teaching/learning video programmes is suggested, controlled by a central agency, for intra and interprofessional exchange, at nominal fees. The comparative lack of research activity by the paramedical professions into the validity and possible application of CCTV, either educationally or clinically, is pointed out and encouragement given to reverse this situation and to communicate findings. © 1985 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract={Various processes have been developed or proposed for converting cellulosic residues from pulp and paper mills into products which can be used for fuel or food. Among the promising practical possibilities are processes for ethanol, methane and microbial protein production by fermentation technology. Given the current Canadian financial climate and product demand, the results of techno-economic sensitivity analyses of these three process options indicate that microbial protein production for animal food applications is the most attractive followed by methane then ethanol, the last being quite uneconomical at present. Ironically, research emphasis seems to be placed in the reverse order. It is evident that the relevant costs of upstream and downstream processing in the various process proposals have not been adequately addressed. Case studies of several scenarios illustrate the problems. © 1985.},

abstract={During the last twenty years there have been major changes in European health services in the need for information, technology and the information user. The need for information for management purposes has been highlighted by the shift away from running institutions to providing health care for defined populations, and the diminution in financial growth available to health services. To provide comprehensive care in the current financial climate there is a requirement for relevant and timely information about the patients being treated, the population from which they come and the cost and effectiveness of the treatment being provided. Major changes have occurred in both the software and hardware available for information technology (IT) applications. Modern technology cannot only process statistical data but also acquire, process, store and disseminate vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information. Among applications of interest to health service managers are quantitative data systems, planning systems, text management systems and communications both within the organisation and with other organisations. Users have become more expert and demanding. They expect IT applications to meet their need, control over IT developments and timely access to their information. The convergence of these changes in information needs, technology and users have led in the first half of the 1980's to the IT reformation. Many of the systems planned twenty years ago have become irrelevant and too expensive for current requirements. Strategies for the implementation of IT have to take cognisance of the implications of the IT reformation. Prescriptive control within the organisation must be replaced by up-to-date technical advice and user education. The key elements which require standardisation are the data content of systems and communications protocols. Applications for clinical services should provide both robust operational systems meeting user needs and the capability for non-technical users such as clinicians and health service managers to obtain high quality information directly. The modularisation of applications will permit users to choose the combination of modules which best meet local needs. The introduction of such systems will break down the traditional barriers between 'administrative' and 'clinical' computing. Linkage between applications should only occur as a consequence of user requirements not because of technical feasibility. Clinical IT applications should all have the capability of accessing the organisation's patient register though not necessarily the power to amend or modify it. The increasing ease of linking machines has made the setting up of a network of linked machines a viable and potentially cheaper approach than the installation of general purpose mainframe or large mini-computers. Organisational changes will be required in many of the European health services if the opportunities afforded by the IT reformation are to be realised.},

abstract={This article is the result of some extensive and lengthy interviews with officers in local and health authorities in two London boroughs. It focuses on their attitudes to resource planning and inter‐authority collaboration in the provision of services for two priority groups — the elderly and the mentally handicapped. The interviews were undertaken in 1980, in the aftermath of the tighter financial climate that followed the 1979 election, and fieldwork continued until 1981. Officers’ views were tested against models of inter‐authority activity drawn from varied literatures. Most officers turned out to have drawn extremely pessimistic conclusions from their experiences. The bureaucratic politics paradigm predominated. Very few participants had come to terms with what planning could mean in a period of declining resources. Most still thought of planning as what to do with the increment and saw little point in planning if there were no increments. However, there were interesting differences between the perceptions of NHS staff and local authority officers, and between those in different kinds of post. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract={This brief review can do no more than draw attention to some of the recent literature. We have attempted to concentrate on laboratory aspects that have direct relevance to either diagnosis or management of patients with rheumatic diseases, and no doubt have omitted some investigative procedures which will, in future, be shown to have fundamental benefits to patient care. However, to employ routinely often costly and labour-intensive assays that have little bearing on either diagnosis or management, but merely provide a 'data base', seems an ill-judged practice in the current financial climate. It is self-evident that we need to further our understanding of most rheumatological disorders, but this is best achieved by detailed research-orientated programmes rather than by the random collection of laboratory data on randomly collected patients.},

abstract={The existing catering technology is the major factor which determines how the work in hospital kitchens is organised. Every patient should receive a sometimes highly special meal and free choice implies that forward planning is difficult. Every finished product is composed of the price of the raw material, wages, other fixed costs and sometimes additional costs. As a rule the wage factor is the decisive cost when pricing catering products. As a result of the growing costs of wages the question must be asked whether it would not be more economical to reorganise the catering operation. As in the present financial climate it is almost impossible to build new facilities thus the solution is a partial or total reorganisation of the kitchen operation without any major building work being required.},

abstract={Trends reflected by Department of Health and Social Security statistics on the nursing workforce are examined and the ratios between grades discussed. Recruitment into nursing degree courses in the UK is considered in relation to overall recruitment into nursing. The somewhat ambiguous position of nursing degree courses in the UK leads into consideration of policy statements by the universities and the nursing profession. The importance of such policies is emphasized in the current financial climate, as are the potential contributions of university departments to professional debate, for example standards of care. Comparisons are drawn between the goals of courses involving full‐time studentships as opposed to part–time apprenticeships and the present boundaries between these noted, especially in relation to the expanding roles of courses. On–going research into the preparation of nurse–tutors in the UK is mentioned, together with a preliminary analysis of the academic basis in the biological sciences possessed by learners and tutors. Out of this is derived a suggestion that the present–day shortage of nurse teachers could be helped by varying the existing patterns of recruitment, especially involving subject specialists in the biological, behavioural and social sciences.

The fate of community medicine is another important factor. What happens to community medicine at reorganisation will have major influence on health education. One inevitable setback will be the severing of existing ties with local education authorities (LEAs). New services will not equate with LEA territories. What is at stake to some extent is established LEA/NHS collaboration in the field of schools' health education. © 1981, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Whilst the assessment of the natural ventilation rates of low-rise buildings is an area of growing concern in the continued search for greater interior comfort standards, this concern is perhaps reflected more in our awareness of the energy impact which this source of heat loss has in the present financial climate. It is surprising therefore that so little is known about air infiltration in the low rise buildings, which continue to comprise the majority of our housing stock. The relatively small amount of data which exists relates only to isolated buildings despite the fact that other spheres of fluid mechanics have for some time recognised the importance of proximity effects in the prediction of fluid flow phenomena. It is the intention of this paper to describe a series of wind tunnel investigations which have led to the development of a procedure by which it is possible to estimate the wind pressure forces which act on a low-rise building which itself is part of a large group of similar buildings. The use of this technique makes it possible to allow for the building form, the parameters which describe the array in which it is situated, the upstream building conditions and the orientation of the wind. Wind speed maps are included in an appendix so that the prediction technique may be applied to the determination of natural ventilation forces on buildings situated in parts of the UK. © 1980, SAGE Publications.

abstract={Improvements in turbopropulsion technology will continue through the '80s. The marketplace will see higher performance, better operability, and lower-cost features for a wide variety of gas-turbine products. The most significant technical advances are expected to come from more sophisticated aerodynamics and heat-transfer designs, improved materials, and new manufacturing methods. Factors such as the fuel situation, new government regulations, raw-materials availability, foreign competition, and complex economic issues will also influence engine requirements in the decade ahead. For military-engine applications, design and development programs will continue to evolve, based on the lessons learned in the past two decases and trials sure to be forthcoming in the '80s. New design and development tools such as CAD/CAM, better materials, processes, and diagnostics, new and better nondestructive inspection, FADEC systems and modern development techniques - all will help create technically superior, more affordable engines in years to come. The success of commercial gas-turbine-powered airplanes during their first two decades of operation demonstrated that the right combination of market factors can promote advanced technology improvements, higher thrust, lower fuel consumption, and higher-bypass-ratio turbofans for airline service. In the years ahead new commercial engines can successfully evolve if technology progresses on all fronts; if rational, timely energy planning satisfies aviation's future needs; if reasonable and appropriate environmental standards are promulgated, and, above all, if a favorable financial and regulatory climate makes profitable growth of the airlines possible.},

The financial effects of the additional cost burden are calculated using a regional simulation model of the electric utility industry. A range of assumptions concerning proposed standards and the regulatory-financial climate are considered. It is concluded that the financial health of the industry is much more dependent on the rate-setting practices of state regulatory commissions than on whether or not an additional cost of 50-100/kW for pollution control is required for coal-burning power plants. This analysis was conducted in the fall of 1977 under contract to the Office of Environmental Policy Analysis of the U. S. Department of Energy. Since the completion of the original calculations, the debate over new Source Performance Standards has accelerated, and the precise version of the standards currently under consideration may differ from the version described in this report.},

abstract={The last decade has witnessed rapid growth in the use of debt financing by American hospitals. It is to be expected, given the present financial climate, that this trend will continue. But it is possible that the providers may not always be in such a favorable position in the future, again because of the financial climate and strains placed in recent times on fire and casualty companies. Some constraint will be exercised through the debt to total capital and the debt to plant and equipment ratios. Rising interest costs and a decrease in net income margins have also meant a restraint on borrowing. This article tabulates the various ratios and, thus, the financial possibilities open to hospitals. It further provides one or two sidelights as regards tax reimbursement.},

abstract={There is no rigid formula for development. The important thing is whether a particular economic and social system produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people within a framework of freedom. The United States and other industrialized countries have progressed remarkably in a relatively short period of time. Time is one cause of disparities-many less developed countries have only recently begun economic and social reforms. To correct existing disparities it was assumed that aid programs would bring rapid progress. These programs were not the whole answer. Attention, therefore, has turned to trade, and in particular to preferences, as a solution. It should be remarked that United States policy has been one of liberal, nondiscriminatory trade. While trade and aid are important to development, it might be asked whether the developing countries are taking adequate self-help measures, such as the promotion of a competitive commercial environment, adequate regional trading arrangements, efficiency and rationalization of their public enterprises, stability in monetary and financial policies, a climate of business confidence, improved fiscal laws and their administration, and land reform. These reforms are illustrative of the tasks that face the developing countries. © 1965, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A factor analysis of 20 sociological, economic, and educational achievement measures based on 84 local communities yielded five orthogonal factors. These may be characterized as I. Urban-Financial, II. Intellectual Climate, III. Economic Stability, IV. Academic Achievement, and V. Low Socio-Economic Status. With the exception of Factor IV each factor parallels a previously isolated factor at the state level. The study thus provides evidence for the existence of these factors at another geographical and political level. Factor IV is highly loaded only with the two achievement test variables included in the analysis. The narrow scope of the factor suggests that high educational achievement can be obtained in widely varying kinds of communities. © 1960, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},
